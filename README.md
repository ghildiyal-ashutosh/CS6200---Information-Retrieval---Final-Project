1. All queries are stored in "quries" file.
1.1. File names that ends with "OriginalIncluded" include both original terms and expanded terms. These versions are used in our project.
1.2. They can be re-generated by running "getQueries.py" in "python" directory.
1.3. Note that when running "getQueries.py", we need two text files "similar.txt" and "derivative.txt". These files store all expansion terms in the 64 queries. For re-generate these files, we need to run "getWordInfo.py", which access the WORDS API (https://www.wordsapi.com/), and a free account only have 2500 hits per day. It should be enough for two or three runs.

2. For evaluation, simply run the file "evaluation.py" in "python" directory.
