* All queries are stored in "quries" file.
    - File names that ends with "OriginalIncluded" include both original terms and expanded terms. These versions are used in our project.
    - All queries can be re-generated by running "getQueries.py" in "python" directory.
    - Note that when running "getQueries.py", we need two text files "similar.txt" and "derivative.txt" (in "python" directory). These files store all expansion terms in the 64 queries. To re-generate these files, we need to run "getWordInfo.py", which access the WORDS API (https://www.wordsapi.com/), and a free account only have 2500 hits per day (by one hit we get information about one word). It should be enough for two or three runs.

* For evaluation, simply run the file "evaluation.py" in "python" directory.
