For BM25:
	I reuesed the previous assignments' code and corpus, and put the key code in BM25.java file. Overall, the steps are:
		1. Indexing the files;
		2. Create the inverted_index lists;
		3. rank;
	It's worth noting that all the documents that do not contain any query terms are ignored from the ranking;

For Lucene:
	I changed all the path into harder coded version, so just run it once, it will show all the results for all the queries.

	It's worth noting that you should delete all the files in "indexes" folder before re-run the program.
