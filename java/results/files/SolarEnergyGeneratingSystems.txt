solar energy generating systems segs in california with the combined capacity from three separate locations at 354 megawatts mw 474,700hp is now the worlds second largest solar thermal energy generating facility after the commissioning of the even larger ivanpah facility in 2014 it consists of nine solar power plants in californias mojave desert where insolation is among the best available in the united states segs iii 44mw are located at daggett 345145n 1164945w 34.86250n 116.82917w 34.86250 -116.82917 segsiiivii 150mw are installed at kramer junction and segs viiiix 160mw are placed at harper lake 3502n 11721w 35.033n 117.350w 35.033 -117.350 nextera energy resources operates and partially owns the plants located at kramer junction and harper lake a tenth plant segs x 80mw had been in construction and segs xi and segs xii had been planned by luz industries but the developer filed for bankruptcy in 1992 because it was unable to secure construction financing the plants have a 354 mw net 394 mw gross installed capacity the nameplate capacity which operating continuously would deliver the same net power output coming only from the solar source is around 75 mwe representing a 21% capacity factor in addition the turbines can be utilized at night by burning natural gas nextera claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homes during the day at peak power and displace 3,800tons of pollution per year that would have been produced if the electricity had been provided by fossil fuels such as oil the facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres 647.5ha lined up the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles 369km as an example of cost in 2002 one of the 30 mw kramer junction sites required 90 million to construct and its operation and maintenance cost was about 3 million per year 4.6 cents per kilowatt hour with a considered lifetime of 20 years the operation maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hourcitation needed the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity about 90% of the electricity is produced by the sunlightcitation needed natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from southern california edison the distributor of power in southern california the parabolic mirrors are shaped like a half-pipe the sun shines onto the panels made of glass which are 94%reflective unlike a typical mirror which is only 70%reflective the mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day the greatest source of mirror breakage is wind with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms an automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels the sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with synthetic oil which heats to over 400c 750f the reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80times more intense than the ordinary sunlight the synthetic oil transfers its heat to water which boils and drives the rankine cycle steam turbine thereby generating electricity synthetic oil is used to carry the heat instead of water to keep the pressure within manageable parameters the segs power plants were built by luz industries and commissioned between 1984 and 1991 after luz industries bankruptcy in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as individual projects and expansion including three more plants was halted kramer junction employs about 95people and 45people work at harper lake segs viii and segs ix located at 350154n 1172053w 35.0316n 117.348w 35.0316 -117.348 segs viii and ix until ivanpah solar power facility commissioning in 2014 were the largest solar thermal power plants individually and collectively in the world they were the last the largest and the most advanced of the nine plants at segs designed to take advantage of the economies of scale construction of the tenth plant in the same locality was halted because of the bankruptcy of luz industries construction of the approved eleventh and twelfth plants never started each of the three planned plants had 80 mw of installed capacity abengoa solar recently constructed the 280mw mojave solar project msp adjacent to thee segs viii and segs ix plants the msp uses concentrating solar thermal technology as the segs projects this location 350051n 1173332w 35.0142n 117.559w 35.0142 -117.559 segs iiivii receives an average of 340days of sunshine per year which makes it an ideal place for solar power generation the average direct normal radiation dnr is 7.44kwhmday 310wm one of the best in the nationcitation needed segs i and ii are located at 345147n 1164937w 34.8631n 116.827w 34.8631 -116.827 segs i and ii and are owned by cogentrix energy carlyle group in february 1999 a 900,000-us-gallon 3,400m3 mineral oil storage tank exploded at the segs i daggett solar power plant sending flames and smoke into the sky authorities were trying to keep flames away from two adjacent containers that held sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide the immediate area of 0.5 square miles 1.3km2 was evacuated
