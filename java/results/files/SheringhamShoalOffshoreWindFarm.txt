sheringham shoal offshore wind farm is an offshore wind farm in the united kingdom by scira owned by statoil and statkraft with 50% each scira has leased the area from the crown estate for 40years the first turbine was connected to the grid in august 2011 the nearest turbine is a minimum distance of approximately 9 nautical miles 17 kilometres to the shore the turbines are supported by foundations secured to the sea bed the wind farm will have a total area of approximately 14sqmi 36km2 the wind farm consists of 88siemens 3.6mw wind turbines model swt-3.6-107 costing 450m 597m giving a total combined nameplate capacity of 317mw the estimated actual output is about 40% of the nameplate capacity ie approximately 125mw 1.1twh per year which is sufficient to power approximately 220,000 average uk homes more than twice the equivalent electricity required to supply the whole of the north norfolk coast the wind farm will avoid about 500,000tonnes per year of carbon dioxide emissions compared to electricity generation from fossil fuels the united kingdom has the largest shallow-water offshore wind resource in the world and it has been estimated that the uk could provide over 33% of the total european potential for offshore wind energycitation needed this is enough to power the country nearly three times over britains relatively shallow waters and strong winds extend far into the north sea the development of the sheringham shoal offshore wind farm is another step towards tapping this vast natural resource the estimated cost of the project is 10 billion norwegian kroner 1.1bn us1.8bn onshore the construction phase includes planning permissions from broadland and north norfolk district councils and grid agreements with edfe and ngt offshore these include the agreement for lease with the crown estate section 36 consent from berr and the marine and fisheries agency license onshore work began in 2009 while offshore installation was scheduled to start in early 2010 with the installation of 90foundations 88for the turbines and two for the offshore substations turbine installation was scheduled to be during the 1st quarter of 2011 and the project was officially opened on september 27 2012 by norways crown prince haakon and secretary of state edward davey in april 2008 cable company nexans was awarded the 24m export cable supply contract by statoil the contract scope includes engineering procurement and construction of two 22km 145kilovolt kv xlpe submarine export cables and a spare cable with associated equipment an optical fibre cable will also be included further nexans also got a 12m 15.8m contract in april 2009 to supply 81km of infield cables and equipment the foundations are pile driven 2337 m into sandy seabed they are 4060m tall with a diameter of about 5m weighing 375531tons big enough that a british double-decker bus could drive inside the tube the two substation foundations and about 17 turbine foundations were installed from june 2010 by mthjgaard using a special method the tube was towed to the site on a barge and the sea crane svanen contracted by mthjgaard and built to construct the great belt fixed link raised one end of the tube while the other end on the barge was fixed to a 135ton giant roller skate with hydraulic motors compensating for wave oscillations which previously hampered operations however due to insufficient logistics the first foundation transport vessel arrived almost three months late the second vessel almost 5 months and the unloading could only take place at limited waveheigts due to the installability of the transport vessels the svanen was not able to install the foundations in time which delayed the foundation works at an estimated cost of 600million nok and during the execution of the work the contract with mthjgaard was terminated by statoil asa and statkraftas seaway heavy lifting took over the contract and from april to august 2011 installed the remaining 66monopile foundations 71transition pieces 25m high 5m wide weight 220tons and the two 8001000tons offshore substations using their newbuild heavy lift vessel oleg strashnov for the job the new installation contracts allowed completion of the sheringham shoal project for full operation in late2012
