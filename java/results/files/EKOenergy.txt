which is one of the biggest media companies in finland for every ekoenergy purchase money goes into the climate fund in the case of ekoenergy from hydropower money also goes into the environmental fund the climate fund finances renewable energy projects the first project funded was a solar energy project in tanzania in 2011 the italian ngo oikos received eu funding to install a small hydro turbine near the ngarenanyuki secondary school in the meru district northern tanzania in the dry season and during irrigation time the school often remains without electricity in may 2014 ekoenergy

cameroon for the swiss organisation solafrica the environmental fund finances river restoration projects which reduce the negative impacts of hydropower production the ekoenergy network took over an existing fund of the old finnish ecolabel for electricity which was managed by fanc since 2009 the environmental fund has donated a total of 564,000 to projects for example ekoenergy invested 50,000 from its environmental fund to bring trout and european crayfish back to the river murronjoki in saarijrvi central finland the contributions to the fund came from sales of ekoenergy labelled hydropower the river murronjoki had been heavily affected by hydropower plants and other industrial activities which were hindering trout migration the european versions of the leed standard explicitly recommend the use of ekoenergy labelled electricity buildings aiming at leed certification can get extra points if the electricity used in that building is ekoenergy certified the text leed 2009 bdc supplemental reference guide with alternative compliance paths for europe gives ekoenergy the same status as green-e certified recs in the us they write the ekoenergy electricity certification scheme represents the best available pan-european option for the sustainable and additional consumption of renewable electricity within europe ekoenergy certifies renewable electricity that goes beyond the regulations of european directives and national governments of europe the greenhouse gas protocol is a worldwide standard for carbon accounting it is a joint product of the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development in january 2015 the secretariat of the greenhouse gas protocol published the scope 2 guidance which gave advice about carbon accounting the guidance refers to ekoenergy several times chapter 11 which encourages companies to go one step further refers to ekoenergys climate fund httpwwwekoenergyorg
