classified as the worlds tallest in 2004 and remained such until the completion of burj khalifa in dubai in 2009 in 2011 the building was awarded the leed platinum certification the highest award according to the leadership in energy and environmental design leed rating system and became the tallest and largest green building in the world taipei 101 was designed by cy lee and partners and was constructed by samsung ct and ktrt joint venture construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004 the tower has served as an icon of modern taiwan ever since its opening the building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and asian tradition its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments the tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes a multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores restaurants and clubs fireworks launched from taipei 101 feature prominently in international new years eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media taipei 101 is primarily owned by pan-government share holders the name originally planned for the building taipei world financial center until 2003 was derived from the name of the owner the original name in chinese was literally taipei international financial center taipei 101 comprises 101 floors above ground as well as 5 basement levels it was not only the first building in the world to break the half-kilometer mark in height but also the worlds tallest building from march 2004 to 10 march 2010 as of 28 july 2011update it is still the worlds largest and highest-use green building upon its completion taipei 101 was the worlds tallest inhabited building at 509.2m 1,671ft as measured to its height architectural top spire exceeding the petronas towers which were previously the tallest inhabited skyscraper at 451.9m 1,483ft the height to the top of the roof at 449.2m 1,474ft and highest occupied floor at 439.2m 1,441ft surpassed the previous records of 442m 1,450ft and 412.4m 1,353ft respectively the willis tower had previously held that distinction it also surpassed the 85-story 347.5m 1,140ft tuntex sky tower in kaohsiung as the tallest building in taiwan and the 51-story 244.15m 801ft shin kong life tower as the tallest building in taipei taipei 101 claimed the official records for the worlds tallest sundial and the worlds largest new years eve countdown clock various sources including the buildings owners give the height of taipei 101 as 508m 1,667ft roof height and top floor height as 448m 1,470ft and 438m 1,437ft this lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a 1.2m 4ft platform at the base ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement taipei 101 displaced the petronas towers as the tallest building in the world by 57.3m 188ft the record it claimed for greatest height from ground to pinnacle was surpassed by the burj khalifa in dubai which is 829.8m 2,722ft in height taipei 101s records for roof height and highest occupied floor briefly passed to the shanghai world financial center in 2008 which in turn yielded these records as well to the burj taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second 197fts 216kmh or 134mph as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding areas geology the building is located just 660 feet away from a major fault line taipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight mega-columns packed with 10,000psi 69mpa concrete outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the buildings core to those on the exterior these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80m 262ft into the ground extending as far as 30m 98ft into the bedrock each pile is 1.5m 5ft in diameter and can bear a load of 1,0001,320 tonnes 1,1001,460 short tons during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed rwdi designed a 660-tonne 728-short-ton steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper at a cost of nt132million us4million suspended from the 92nd to the 87th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts its sphere the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125mm 4.92in thick welded together to form a 5.5m 18ft diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes 7 short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads on 8 august 2015 strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres 39in the largest movement ever recorded by the damper the damper has become such a hot tourist attraction the city created a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby rich gold cool black smart silver and lucky red were design and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper baby with its cute all-ages appeal has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website taipei 101s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes 8 short tons the faade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this faade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95mm of seismic lateral displacements without damage the original corners of the facade were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour 169kmh wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final designs double stairstep corner faade architect cy lee also used extensive faade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these faade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two faade sections among others taipei 101s own roof and faade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the buildings water needs in july 2011 taipei 101 was certified the worlds tallest green building under leed standards the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built 1001 and all the new years that follow 1 january 1-01 it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100 a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune in cultures that observe a seven-day week the number eight symbolizes a renewal of time 71 in digital technology the number eight is associated with the byte being 8 bits a bit is the basic minimal unit of information the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the buildings shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in western-style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1 curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8m 26ft tall at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 600 to 1000 each evening the towers lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum the colors coincide with the days of the week the cycle through the spectrum connects the tower with the rich symbolism of rainbows in culture that associate the image with connection and new beginnings the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the buildings occupants the parks design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the buildings wind shear taipei 101 like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the towers east entrance a ball at the fountains top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the towers rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or chi from a structure and its occupants placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of chi taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation the original 2004 fiber-optic and satellite internet connections permitted transfer speeds up

retail outlets also operate in the adjoining mall the multi-story retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores restaurants clubs and other attractions the malls interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements the curled ruyi symbol is a recurring motif inside the mall many features of the interior also observe feng shui traditions the 101st floor is home to a private vip club named summit 101 according to the observatory brochure before 2014 no information about this club was ever made public in 2014 photos of the exclusive club were

initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in taipeis 101 business district planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it along with many of the other features used in the design of the building it wasnt until the summer of 2001 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site in the meantime construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2000 a major earthquake took place in taiwan during 31 march 2002 destroying a construction crane at the roof top which was at floor number 47 the crane fell down onto the xinyi road beneath the tower crushing several vehicles and causing five deaths two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed however an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction work was able to restart within a week taipei 101s roof
