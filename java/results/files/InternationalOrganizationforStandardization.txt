the international organization for standardization iso is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations founded on 23 february 1947 the organization promotes worldwide proprietary industrial and commercial standards it is headquartered in geneva switzerland and as of 2013 works in 164 countries it was one of the first organizations granted general consultative status with the united nations economic and social council iso the international organization for standardization is an independent non-governmental organization the members of which are the standards organization of the 164 member countries it is the worlds largest developer of voluntary international standards and facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations nearly twenty thousand standards have been set covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety agriculture and healthcare use of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe reliable and of good quality the standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste by enabling products from different markets to be directly compared they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis the standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally the three official languages of the iso are english french and russian the name of the organization in french is organisation internationale de normalisation and in russian according to the iso as its name in different languages would have different abbreviations ios in english oin in french etc the organization adopted iso as its abbreviated name in reference to the greek word isos meaning equal however during the founding meetings of the new organization this greek word was not evoked so this explanation may have been imagined later both the name iso and the logo are registered trademarks and their use is restricted the organization today known as iso began in 1926 as the international federation of the national standardizing associations isa it was suspended in 1942 during world warii but after the war isa was approached by the recently formed united nations standards coordinating committee unscc with a proposal to form a new global standards body in october 1946 isa and unscc delegates from 25 countries met in london and agreed to join forces to create the new international organization for standardization the new organization officially began operations in february1947 iso is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized authorities on standards each one representing one country members meet annually at a general assembly to discuss isos strategic objectives the organization is coordinated by a central secretariat based in geneva a council with a rotating membership of 20 member bodies provides guidance and governance including setting the central secretariats annual budget the technical management board is responsible for over 250 technical committees who develop the iso standards iso has formed joint committees with the international electrotechnical commission iec to develop standards and terminology in the areas of electrical electronic and related technologies isoiec joint technical committee 1 jtc 1 was created in 1987 to develop maintain promote and facilitate it standards isoiec joint technical committee 2 jtc 2 was created in 2009 for the purpose of standardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources iso has 162 national members out of the 206 total countries in the world iso has three membership categories participating members are called p members as opposed to observing members who are called o members iso is funded by a combination of isos main products are international standards iso also publishes technical reports technical specifications publicly available specifications technical corrigenda and guides these are meta-standards covering matters related to international standardization they are named using the format isoiec guide nyyyy title for example iso documents are copyrighted and iso charges for most copies it does not however charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format although they are useful care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards some standards by iso and its official us representative and via the us national committee the international electrotechnical commission are made freely available a standard published by isoiec is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee here are some abbreviations used for marking a standard with its status abbreviations used for amendments other abbreviations international standards are developed by iso technical committeestc and subcommitteessc by a process with six steps the tcsc may set up working groupswg of experts for the preparation of a working drafts subcommittees may have several working groups which can have several sub groups sg it is possible to omit certain stages if there is a document with a certain degree of maturity at the start of a standardization project for example a standard developed by another organization isoiec directives allow also the so-called fast-track procedure in this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft international standard dis to the iso member bodies or as a final draft international standard fdis if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the iso council the first stepa proposal of work new proposal is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee egsc29 and jtc1 respectively in the case of moving picture experts group - isoiec jtc1sc29wg11 a working group wg of experts is set up by the tcsc for the preparation of a working draft when the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified some of the working groups egmpeg usually make open request for proposalsknown as a call for proposals the first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification modelvm previously also called a simulation and test model when a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached a working draftwd is produced this is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision when a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed it becomes committee draftcd if it is required it is then sent to the p-members of the tcsc national bodies for ballot the cd becomes final committee draft fcd if the number of positive votes is above the quorum successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content when it is reached the text is finalized for submission as a draft international standard dis the text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months it is approved for submission as a final draft international standardfdis if a two-thirds majority of the p-members of the tcsc are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative iso will then hold a ballot with national bodies where no technical changes are allowed yesno ballot within a period of two months it is approved as an international standardis if a two-thirds majority of the p-members of the tcsc is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative after approval only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text the final text is sent to the iso central secretariat which publishes it as the international standard the fact that many of the iso-created standards are ubiquitous has led on occasion to common use of iso to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard some examples of this are with the exception of a small number of isolated standards iso standards are normally not available free of charge but for a purchase fee which has been seen by some as too expensive for small open source projects the isoiec jtc1 fast-track procedures fast-track as used by ooxml and pas as used by opendocument have garnered criticism in relation to the standardization of office open xml isoiec29500 martin bryan outgoing convenor of isoiec jtc1sc34 wg1 is quoted as saying i would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass wg1s outstanding standards over to oasis where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a pas submission to iso which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within wg1 the disparity of rules for pas fast-track and iso committee generated standards is fast making iso a laughing stock in it circles the days of open standards development are fast disappearing instead we are getting standardization by corporation computer security entrepreneur and ubuntu investor mark shuttleworth commented on the standardization of office open xml process by saying i think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process and shuttleworth alleged that iso did not carry out its responsibility he also noted that microsoft had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in iso and stacked technical committees with microsoft employees solution providers and resellers sympathetic to office open xml when you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused iso should halt the process iso is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results the process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate lobbying and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear
