hard water is water that has high mineral content in contrast with soft water hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates hard drinking water may have moderate health benefits but can pose serious problems in industrial settings where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers cooling towers and other equipment that handles water in domestic settings hard water is often indicated by a lack of suds formation when soap is agitated in water and by the formation of limescale in kettles and water heaters wherever water hardness is a concern water softening is commonly used to reduce hard waters adverse effects waters hardness is determined by the concentration of multivalent cations in the water multivalent cations are positively charged metal complexes with a charge greater than 1 usually the cations have the charge of 2 common cations found in hard water include ca2 and mg2 these ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an aquifer common calcium-containing minerals are calcite and gypsum a common magnesium mineral is dolomite which also contains calcium rainwater and distilled water are soft because they contain few ions the following equilibrium reaction describes the dissolving and formation of calcium carbonate the reaction can go in either direction rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it the calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to atmosphere sometimes forming stalactites and stalagmites calcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners temporary hardness is a type of water hardness caused by the presence of dissolved bicarbonate minerals calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate when dissolved these minerals yield calcium and magnesium cations ca2 mg2 and carbonate and bicarbonate anions co32 hco3 the presence of the metal cations makes the water hard however unlike the permanent hardness caused by sulphate and chloride compounds this temporary hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water or by the addition of lime calcium hydroxide through the softening process of lime softening boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution leaving water that is softer upon cooling permanent hardness is hardness mineral content that cannot be removed by boiling when this is the case it is usually caused by the presence of calcium sulphate andor magnesium sulphates in the water which do not precipitate out as the temperature increases ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener or ion exchange column total permanent hardness calcium hardness magnesium hardness the calcium and magnesium hardness is the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions expressed as equivalent of calcium carbonate total permanent water hardness expressed as equivalent of caco3 can be calculated with the following formula total permanent hardness caco3 2.5ca2 4.1mg2 with hard water soap solutions form a white precipitate soap scum instead of producing lather because the 2 ions destroy the surfactant properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate the soap scum a major component of such scum is calcium stearate which arises from sodium stearate the main component of soap hardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap synthetic detergents do not form such scums hard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing these deposits called scale are composed mainly of calcium carbonate caco3 magnesium hydroxide mgoh2 and calcium sulfate caso4 calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers this precipitation formation of an insoluble solid is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration the resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes in boilers the deposits impair the flow of heat into water reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat in a pressurized system this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler the damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form for example calcite or aragonite the presence of ions in an electrolyte in this case hard water can also lead to galvanic corrosion in which one metal will preferentially corrode when in contact with another type of metal when both are in contact with an electrolyte the softening of hard water by ion exchange does not increase its corrosivity per se similarly where lead plumbing is in use softened water does not substantially increase plumbo-solvency in swimming pools hard water is manifested by a turbid or cloudy milky appearance to the water calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water the solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong group 2 of the periodic table increases moving down the column aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air forming the insoluble carbonates giving rise to the turbidity this often results from the ph being excessively high ph 7.6 hence a common solution to the problem is while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level to lower the ph by the addition of hydrochloric acid the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6 it is often desirable to soften hard water most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants for this reason water softening is often unnecessary where softening is practised it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters a common method for water softening involves the use of ion exchange resins which replace ions like ca2 by twice the number of monocations such as sodium or potassium ions washing soda sodium carbonate - na2co3 is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent the world health organization says that there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans in fact the united states national research council has found that hard water can actually serve as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium some studies have shown a weak inverse relationship between water hardness and cardiovascular disease in men up to a level of 170mg calcium carbonate per litre of water the world health organization has reviewed the evidence and concluded the data was inadequate to allow for a recommendation for a level of hardness recommendations have been made for the maximum and minimum levels of calcium 4080 ppm and magnesium 2030 ppm in drinking water and a total hardness expressed as the sum of the calcium and magnesium concentrations of 24mmoll other studies have shown weak correlations between cardiovascular health and water hardness some studies correlate domestic hard water usage with increased eczema in children the softened-water eczema trial swet a multicenter randomized controlled trial of ion-exchange softeners for treating childhood eczema was undertaken in 2008 however no meaningful difference in symptom relief was found between children with access to a home water softener and those without hardness can be quantified by instrumental analysis the total water hardness is the sum of the molar concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in moll or mmoll units although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium the two most prevalent divalent metal ions iron aluminium and manganese can also be present at elevated levels in some locations the presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish rust-like colour to the calcification instead of white the color of most of the other compounds water hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration but rather in various units such as degrees of general hardness dgh german degrees dh parts per million ppm mgl or american degrees grains per gallon gpg english degrees e e or clark or french degrees fh f or f lowercase f is used to prevent confusion with degrees fahrenheit the table below shows conversion factors between the various units the various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide cao or calcium carbonate caco3 that when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water would result in the same total molar concentration of mg2 and ca2 the different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ and that different mass and volume units are used the units are as follows because it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water together with the waters ph and temperature that determine the behavior of the hardness a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness however the united states geological survey uses the following classification into hard and soft water seawater is considered to be very hard due to various dissolved salts typically seawaters hardness is in the range of 6630 ppm in contrast freshwater has hardness in the range of 15 - 375 ppm several indices are used to describe the behaviour of calcium carbonate in water oil or gas mixtures the langelier saturation index sometimes langelier stability index is a calculated number used to predict the calcium carbonate stability of water it indicates whether the water will precipitate dissolve or be in equilibrium with calcium carbonate in 1936 wilfred langelier developed a method for predicting the ph at which water is saturated in calcium carbonate called phs the lsi is expressed as the difference between the actual system ph and the saturation ph if the actual ph of the water is below the calculated saturation ph the lsi is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential if the actual ph exceeds phs the lsi is positive and being supersaturated with caco3 the water has a tendency to form scale at increasing positive index values the scaling potential increases in practice water with an lsi between -0.5 and 0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties water with an lsi below -0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an lsi above 0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties the lsi is temperature sensitive the lsi becomes more positive as the water temperature increases this has particular implications in situations where well water is used the temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the lsi measurement is made this increase in temperature can cause scaling especially in cases such as hot water heaters conversely systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling the ryznar stability index rsi uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry ryznar saturation index rsi was developed from empirical observations of corrosion rates and film formation in steel mains it is defined as the puckorius scaling index psi uses slightly different parameters to quantify the relationship between the saturation state of the water and the amount of limescale deposited other indices include the larson-skold index the stiff-davis index and the oddo-tomson index the hardness of local water supplies depends on the source of water water in streams flowing over volcanic igneous rocks will be soft while water from boreholes drilled into porous rock is normally very hard analysis of water hardness in major australian cities by the australian water association shows a range from very soft melbourne to very hard adelaide total hardness levels of calcium carbonate in ppm are canberra 40 melbourne 1026 sydney 39.460.1 perth 29226 brisbane 100 adelaide 134148 hobart 5.834.4 darwin 31 prairie provinces mainly saskatchewan and manitoba contain high quantities of calcium and magnesium often as dolomite which are readily soluble in the groundwater that contains high concentrations of trapped carbon dioxide from the last glaciation in these parts of canada the total hardness in ppm of calcium carbonate equivalent frequently exceed 200 ppm if groundwater is the only source of potable water the west coast by contrast has unusually soft water derived mainly from mountain lakes fed by glaciers and snowmelt some typical values are montreal 116 ppm calgary 165 ppm regina 496 ppm saskatoon 160-180 ppm winnipeg 77 ppm toronto 121 ppm vancouver 3 ppm charlottetown pei 140150 ppm waterloo region 400 ppm guelph 460 ppm information from the british drinking water inspectorate shows that drinking water in england is generally considered to be very hard with most areas of england particularly east of a line between the severn and tees estuaries exhibiting above 200 ppm for the calcium carbonate equivalent water in london for example is mostly obtained from the river thames and river lea both of which derive significant proportion of their dry weather flow from springs in limestone and chalk aquifers wales devon cornwall and parts of north-west england are softer water areas and range from 0 to 200 ppm in the brewing industry in england and wales water is often deliberately hardened with gypsum in the process of burtonisation generally water is mostly hard in urban areas of england where soft water sources are unavailable a number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the industrial revolution and urban population burgeoned manchester was a notable such city in north west england and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at thirlmere and haweswater in the lake district to the north there is no exposure to limestone or chalk in their headwaters and consequently the water quality in manchester is rated as very soft similarly tap water in birmingham is also soft as it is sourced from the elan valley reservoirs in wales the epa has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given in this section reference to original eu documentation is given which sets out no limit for hardness in turn the handbook also gives no recommended or mandatory limit values for hardness the handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as moderately hard effects are seen increasingly the chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap and more important that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation these effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mgl caco3 a collection of data from the united states found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent placing them in the categories hard or very hard the other half were classified as soft or moderately hard more than 85% of american homes have hard water the softest waters occur in parts of the new england south atlantic-gulf pacific northwest and hawaii regions moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the tennessee great lakes and alaska regions hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country the hardest waters greater than 1,000 ppm are in streams in texas new mexico kansas arizona and southern california
