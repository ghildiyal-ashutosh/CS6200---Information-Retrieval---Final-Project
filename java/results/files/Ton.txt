the ton is a unit of measure it has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years it is used principally as a unit of mass its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the freight ton it can also be used as a measure of energy for truck classification or as a colloquial term it is derived from the tun the term applied to a barrel of the largest size this could contain a volume between 175 and 213 imperial gallons 210 and 256usgal which could weigh around 2,000 pounds 910kg and occupy some 60 cubic feet 1.7m3 of space in the united kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 pounds 1,016kg avoirdupois pounds from 1965 the uk embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units including the tonne metric ton defined as 1000kg 2,204.6 lbs the uk weights and measures act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms including the ton and the term metric ton for tonne in the united states and formerly canada a ton is defined to be 2,000 pounds 907kg where confusion is possible the 2240lb ton is called long ton and the 2000lb ton short ton the tonne is distinguished by its spelling but usually pronounced the same as ton hence the us term metric ton in the uk the final e of tonne can also be pronounced tn or metric ton when it is necessary to make the distinction where accuracy is required the correct term must be used but for many purposes this is not necessary the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6% and the short ton is within 11% of both the ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech the term ton is also used to refer to a number of units of volume ranging from 35 to 100 cubic feet 0.99 to 2.83m3 in capacity it can also be used as a unit of energy expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt or tnt detonated in refrigeration a ton is a unit of power sometimes called a ton of refrigeration it is the power required to melt or freeze one short ton of ice per day the refrigeration tonhour is a unit of energy the energy required to melt or freeze 124 short ton of ice there are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton mainly uk in the uk canada australia and other areas that had used the imperial system the tonne is the form of ton legal in trade 1.58% less than the long ton both the long ton and the short ton are 20 hundredweight being 112 and 100 pounds respectively before the twentieth century there were several definitions prior to the 15th century in england the ton was 20hundredweight each of 108lb giving a ton of 2,160 pounds 980kgcitation needed in the nineteenth century in different parts of britain definitions of 2240 2352 and 2400lb were used with 2000lb for explosives the legal ton was usually sic 2240lb assay ton abbreviation at is not a unit of measurement but a standard quantity used in assaying ores of precious metals it is 2916 grams short assay ton or 3223 grams long assay ton the amount which bears the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a troy ounce in other words the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample of this size gives the number of troy ounces contained in a short or long ton of ore in documents that predate 1960 the word ton is sometimes spelled tonne but in more recent documents tonne refers exclusively to the metric ton in nuclear power plants thm and mthm mean tonnes of heavy metals and mtu means tonnes of uranium in the steel industry the abbreviation thm means tonstonnes hot metal which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced particularly in the context of blast furnace production or specific consumption a dry ton or dry tonne has the same mass value but the material sludge slurries compost and similar mixtures in which solid material is soaked with or suspended in water has been dried to a relatively low consistent moisture level dry weight if the material is in its natural wet state it is called a wet ton or wet tonne the displacement essentially the weight of a ship is traditionally expressed in long tons to simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the volume rather than weight of water displaced and calculating the weight from the volume and density for practical purposes the displacement ton dt is a unit of volume 35 cubic feet 0.9911m3 the approximate volume occupied by one ton of seawater the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature it is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons 1.018m3 of the water ton based on distilled water one measurement ton or freight ton is equal to 40 cubic feet 1.133m3 but historically it has had several different definitions it is sometimes abbreviated as mton the freight ton represents the volume of a truck train or other freight carrier in the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred it is correctly abbreviated as ftcitation needed but some users are now using freight ton to represent a weight of 1 tonne 1,000kg 2,205lb thus the more common abbreviations are now mt mt or mton for measurement ton which still cause it to be confused with the tonne or even the megatonne the register ton is a unit of volume used for the cargo capacity of a ship defined as 100 cubic feet 2.832m3 it is often abbreviated rt or grt for gross registered ton the former providing confusion with the refrigeration ton it is known as a tonneau de mer in belgium but in france a tonneau de mer is 1.44 cubic metres 50.85cuft the panama canaluniversal measurement system pcums is based on net tonnage modified for panama canal billing purposes pcums is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessels total volume a pcums net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity the water ton is used chiefly in great britain in statistics dealing with petroleum products and is defined as 224 imperial gallons 35.96cuft 1.018m3 the volume occupied by 1 long ton 2,240lb 1,016kg of water under the conditions that define the imperial gallon note that these are small calories cal the large or dietary calorie cal is equal to one kilocalorie kcal and is gradually being replaced by the latter correct term early values for the explosive energy released by trinitrotoluene tnt ranged from 900 to 1100 calories per gram in order to standardise the use of the term tnt as a unit of energy an arbitrary value was assigned based on 1000 calories 1kcal or 4.184kj per gram thus there is no longer a direct connection to the chemical tnt itself it is now merely a unit of energy that happens to be expressed using words normally associated with mass eg kilogram tonne pound the definition applies for both spellings ton of tnt and tonne of tnt measurements in tons of tnt have been used primarily to express nuclear weapon yields though they have also been used since in seismology as well a tonne of oil equivalent toe sometimes ton of oil equivalent is a conventional value based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil the unit is used for example by the international energy agency iea for the reported world energy consumption as tpes in millions of toe mtoe other sources convert 1 toe into 1.28tce one toe is also define as 6.68.0 actual barrels of oil boe depending on actual specific gravitycitation needed a tonne of coal equivalent tce sometimes ton of coal equivalent is a conventional value based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of coal plural name is tonnes of coal equivalent the unit ton is used in refrigeration and air conditioning to measure the rate of heat absorption prior to the introduction of mechanical refrigeration cooling was accomplished by delivering ice installing one ton of mechanical refrigeration capacity replaced the daily delivery of one ton of ice a refrigeration ton should be regarded as power produced by a chiller when operating in standard ahri conditions which are typically 44f 7c for chilled water unit and 95f 35c air entering the condenser this is commonly referred to as true ton manufacturers can also provide tables for chillers operating at other chilled water temperature conditions as 65f or 18.3c which can show more favorable data which are not valid when making performance comparisons among units unless conversion rates are appliedcitation needed the refrigeration ton is commonly abbreviated as rt
