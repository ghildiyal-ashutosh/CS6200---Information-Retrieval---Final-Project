greywater also spelled graywater or sullage is all wastewater generated in households or office buildings from streams without fecal contamination ie all streams except for the wastewater from toilets sources of greywater include eg sinks showers baths clothes washing machines or dish washers as greywater contains fewer pathogens than domestic wastewater it is generally safer to handle and easier to treat and reuse onsite for toilet flushing landscape or crop irrigation and other non-potable uses however the use of non-toxic and low-sodium soap and personal care products is recommended to protect vegetation when reusing greywater for irrigation purposes the application of greywater reuse in urban water systems provides substantial benefits for both the water supply subsystem by reducing the demand for fresh clean water as well as the wastewater subsystems by reducing the amount of wastewater required to be conveyed and treated greywater by definition does not include the discharge of toilets or fecally contaminated wastewater of any kind which is designated sewage or blackwater to indicate it contains human waste however under certain conditions traces of feces and therefore pathogens might enter the greywater stream via effluent from the shower or washing machine when greywater is mixed with toilet wastewater it is called sewage or blackwater and should be treated in sewage treatment plants or onsite sewage facility which often is a septic system when it is kept separate it may open up interesting decentralized treatment and reuse options the separate treatment of greywater falls under the concept of source separation which is one principle commonly applied in ecological sanitation approaches the main advantage of keeping greywater separate from toilet wastewater is that the pathogen load is much reduced and the greywater is therefore easier to treat and reuse treated greywater has many uses for example toilet flushing or irrigation most greywater is easier to treat and recycle than blackwater sewage because of lower levels of contaminants if collected using a separate plumbing system from blackwater domestic greywater can be recycled directly within the home garden or company and used either immediately or processed and stored if stored it must be used within a very short time or it will begin to putrefy due to the organic solids in the water recycled greywater of this kind is never safe to drink but a number of treatment steps can be used to provide water for washing or flushing toilets the treatment processes that can be used are in principle the same as those used for sewage treatment except that they are usually installed on a smaller scale decentralized level often at household or building level in constructed wetlands the plants use contaminants of greywater such as food particles as nutrients in their growth however salt and soap residues can be toxic to microbial and plant life alike but can be absorbed and degraded through constructed wetlands and aquatic plants such as sedges rushes and grasses greywater use for irrigation appears to be a safe practice a 2015 epidemiological study found no additional burden of disease among graywater users irrigating arid regions the safety of reuse of greywater as potable water has also been studied a few organic micropollutants including benzene were found in greywater in significant concentrations but most pollutants were in very low concentrations most greywater should be assumed to have some blackwater-type components including pathogens greywater should be applied below the surface where possible eg via drip line on top of the soil under mulch or in mulch-filled trenches and not sprayed as there is a danger of inhaling the water as an aerosol in any greywater system it is important to avoid toxic materials such as bleaches bath salts artificial dyes chlorine-based cleansers strong acidsalkali solvents and products containing boron which is toxic to plants at high levels most cleaning agents contain sodium salts which can cause excessive soil alkalinity inhibit seed germination and destroy the structure of soils by dispersing clay soils watered with greywater systems can be amended with gypsum calcium sulfate to reduce ph cleaning products containing ammonia are safe to use as plants can use it to obtain nitrogen a 2010 study of greywater irrigation found no major health effects on plants and suggests sodium buildup is largely dependent on the degree to which greywater migrates vertically through the soil some greywater may be applied directly from the sink to the garden or container field receiving further treatment from soil life and plant roots recycled greywater from showers and bathtubs can be used for flushing toilets in most european and australian jurisdictions and in united states jurisdictions that have adopted the international plumbing code such a system could provide an estimated 30% reduction in water use for the average household the danger of biological contamination is avoided by using the uniform plumbing code adopted in some us jurisdictions prohibits greywater use indoors greywater recycling without treatment is used in certain dwellings for applications where potable water is not required eg garden and land irrigation toilet flushing it may also be used in dwellings when the greywater eg from rainwater is already fairly clean to begin with andor has not been polluted with non-degradable chemicals such as non-natural soaps thus using natural cleaning products instead it is not recommended to use water that has been in the greywater filtration system for more than 24 hours or bacteria builds up affecting the water that is being reused devices are currently available that capture heat from residential and industrial greywater through a process called drainwater heat recovery greywater heat recovery or hot water heat recycling rather than flowing directly into a water heating device incoming cold water flows first through a heat exchanger where it is pre-warmed by heat from greywater flowing out from such activities as dishwashing or showering typical household devices receiving greywater from a shower can recover up to 60% of the heat that would otherwise go to wastecitation needed demand on conventional water supplies and pressure on sewage treatment systems is reduced by the use of greywater re-using greywater also reduces the volume of sewage effluent entering watercourses which can be ecologically beneficial in times of drought especially in urban areas greywater use in gardens or toilet systems helps to achieve some of the goals of ecologically sustainable development the potential ecological benefits of greywater recycling include in the us southwest and the middle east where available water supplies are limited especially in view of a rapidly growing population a strong imperative exists for adoption of alternative water technologies government regulation governing domestic greywater use for landscape irrigation diversion for reuse is still a developing area and continues to gain wider support as the actual risks and benefits are considered and put into clearer perspective greywater by pure legal definition is considered in some jurisdictions to be sewage all wastewater including greywater and toilet waste but in the us states that adopt the international plumbing code it can be used for subsurface irrigation and for toilet flushing and in states that adopt the uniform plumbing code it can be used in underground disposal fields that are akin to shallow sewage disposal fields wyoming allows surface and subsurface irrigation and other non-specific use of greywater under a department of environmental quality policy enacted in march 2010 california utah new mexico and some other states allow true subsurface drip irrigation with greywater where greywater is still considered sewage it is bound by the same regulatory procedures enacted to ensure properly engineered septic tank and effluent disposal systems are installed for long system life and to control spread of disease and pollution in such regulatory jurisdictions this has commonly meant domestic greywater diversion for landscape irrigation was either not permitted or was discouraged by expensive and complex sewage system approval requirements wider legitimate community greywater diversion for landscape irrigation has subsequently been handicapped and resulted in greywater reuse continuing to still be widely undertaken by householders outside of and in preference to the legal avenues however with water conservation becoming a necessity in a growing number of jurisdictions business political and community pressure has made regulators seriously reconsider the actual risks against actual benefits it is now recognized and accepted by an increasing number of regulatorscitation needed that the microbiological risks of greywater reuse at the single dwelling level where inhabitants already had intimate knowledge of that greywater are in reality an insignificant risk when properly managed without the need for an onerous approval processes this is reflected in the new south wales government department of water and energys newly released greywater diversion rules and the recent passage of greywater legislation in montana in the 2009 legislative session the state of montana passed a bill expanding greywater use into multi-family and commercial buildings the department of environmental quality has already drafted rules and design guidelines for greywater re-use systems in all these applications existing staff would review systems proposed for new subdivisions in conjunction with review of all other wastewater system components strict permits requirements in austin texas led to issuance of only one residential graywater permit since 2010 a working group formed to streamline the permitting process and in 2013 the city created new code that has eased the requirements resulting in four more permits in california a push has been made in recent years to address greywater in connection with the states greenhouse gas reduction goals see ab 32 as a large amount of energy electricity is used for pumping treating and transporting potable water within the state water conservation has been identified as one of several ways california is seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in july 2009 the california building standards commission cbsc approved the addition of chapter 16a non-potable water reuse systems to the 2007 california plumbing code emergency regulations allowing greywater reuse systems were subsequently filed with the california secretary of state august 2009 and became effective immediately upon filing assembly bill 371 goldberg 2006 and senate bill 283 desaulnier 2009 directed the california department of water resources dwr in consultation with the state department of health services to adopt and submit to the cbsc regulations for a state version of appendix j renamed chapter 16 part 2 of the uniform plumbing code to provide design standards to safely plumb buildings with both potable and recycled water systems november 2009 the cbsc unanimously voted to approve the california dual plumbing code that establishes statewide standards for potable and recycled water plumbing systems in commercial retail and office buildings theaters auditoriums condominiums schools hotels apartments barracks dormitories jails prisons and reformatories in addition the california department of housing and community development has greywater standards and dwr has also proposed dual plumbing design standards
