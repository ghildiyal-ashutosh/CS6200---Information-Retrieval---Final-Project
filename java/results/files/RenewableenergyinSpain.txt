renewable energy in spain represented 42.8% of total electricity generation in 2014 overall 27.4% of spains electricity was generated from wind and solar in 2014 spain has set the target of generating 45% of its energy needs from renewable energy sources in the first half of 2013 the renewable energy sector in spain underwent a major restructuring that will make the official targets very hard to meet the electricity genaration mix in spain from all sources can be viewed live on the red electrica de espana website contribution of renewable energy to total electricity generation in spain percentage electricity generation by renewables installed windpower capacity mw installed capacity mw spain is the worlds fourth biggest producer of wind power in 2014 the year-end installed capacity was 23 gw and the annual production was 51,439 gwh a share of total electricity consumption of 21.1% annual generation in gwh gwh annual production annual electricity generation from hydroelectric sources varies considerably from year to year a rough calculation shows that the contribution to total net generation varied approximately between 9-17 percent annually this variation helps explain the fluctuating annual figures for total renewable energy in spain installed capacity growth in installed capacity in 2005 spain became the first country in europe to require the installation of photovoltaic electricity generation in new buildings and the second in the world after israel to require the installation of solar hot water systems with the construction of the ps10 located near seville spain became the first country to ever have a commercial solar energy power tower in recent years there has been much controversy over a tax on pv power generation as the cost of pv solar installations has reached grid parity in spain according to several sources growth in installed capacity production by source and autonomous community
