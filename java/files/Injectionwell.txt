an injection well is a device that places fluid deep underground into porous rock formations such as sandstone or limestone or into or below the shallow soil layer the fluid may be water wastewater brine salt water or water mixed with chemicals the us environmental protection agency epa defines an injection well as a bored drilled or driven shaft or a dug hole that is deeper than it is wide or an improved sinkhole or a subsurface fluid distribution system well construction depends on the injection fluid injected and depth of the injection zone deep wells that are designed to inject hazardous wastes or carbon dioxide deep below the earths surface have multiple layers of protective casing and cement whereas shallow wells injecting non-hazardous fluids into or above drinking water sources are more simply constructed injection wells are used for many purposes in waste water disposal treated waste water is injected into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting fresh water supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation in order to prevent injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment injection wells are widely consideredby whom to be the best method for disposal of treated waste watercitation needed unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water this method of waste water disposal also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area further decreasing environmental impacts critics of waste water injection wellswho cite concerns relating to the injectate polluting receiving waters most environmental engineering professionalswho however consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells to be the most cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatmentcitation needed the only known alternatives to injection wells are direct discharge of treated waste water to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation direct discharge does not disperse the water over a wide area the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody extensive irrigation is often prohibitively expensive and requires ongoing maintenance and large electricity usagecitation needed since the early 1990s maui county hawaii has been engaged in a struggle over the 3-5 million gallons per day of wastewater that it injects below the lahaina sewage treatment plant over the claim that the water was emerging in seeps that were causing algae blooms and other environmental damage after some twenty years it was sued by environmental groups after multiple studies showed that more than half the injectate was appearing in nearby coastal waters the judge in the suit rejected the countys arguments potentially subjecting it to millions of dollars in federal fines a 2001 consent decree required the county to obtain a water quality certification from the hawaii department of health which it failed to do until after the suit was filed another use of injection wells is in natural gas and petroleum production steam carbon dioxide water and other substances can be injected into an oil-producing unit in order to maintain reservoir pressure heat the oil or lower its viscosity allowing it to flow to a producing well nearby yet another use for injection wells is in environmental remediation for cleanup of either soil or groundwater contamination injection wells can insert clean water into an aquifer thereby changing the direction and speed of groundwater flow perhaps towards extraction wells downgradient which could then more speedily and efficiently remove the contaminated groundwater injection wells can also be used in cleanup of soil contamination for example by use of an ozonation system complex hydrocarbons and other contaminants trapped in soil and otherwise inaccessible can be broken down by ozone a highly reactive gas often with greater cost-effectiveness than could be had by digging out the affected area such systems are particularly useful in built-up urban environments where digging may be impractical due to overlying buildings recently the option of refilling natural aquifers with injection or percolation has become more important particularly in the driest region of the world the mena region middle east and north africa surface runoff can also be recharged into dry wells or simply barren wells that have been modified to functions as cisterns these hybrid stormwater management systems called recharge wells have the advantage of aquifer recharge and instantaneous supply of potable water at the same time they can utilize existing infrastructure and require very little effort for the modification and operation the activation can be as simple as inserting a polymer cover foil into the well shaft vertical pipes for conduction of the overflow to the bottom can enhance performance the area around the well acts as funnel if this area is maintained well the water will require little purification before it enters the cistern in the united states injection well activity is regulated by epa and state governments under the safe drinking water act sdwa epa has issued underground injection control uic regulations in order to protect drinking water sources epa regulations define six classes of injection wells class i wells are used for the injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water class ii wells are used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production including waste from hydraulic fracturing class iii wells are used for the injection of fluids used in mineral solution mining beneath underground sources of drinking water class iv wells like class i wells are used for the injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below class v wells are those used for all non-hazardous injections that are not covered by classes i through iv examples of class v wells include stormwater drainage wells and septic system leach fields finally class vi wells are used for the injection of carbon dioxide for sequestration or long term storage currently there are no class vi wells in operation but 6 to 10 wells are expected to be in use by 2016 a july 2013 study by us geological survey scientist william ellsworth links earthquakes to wastewater injection sites in the four years from 2010-2013 the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the central and eastern united states increased dramatically after decades of a steady earthquake rate average of 21 eventsyear activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011 usgs scientists have found that at some locations the increase in seismicity coincides with the injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells injection-induced earthquakes are thought to be caused by pressure changes due to excess fluid injected deep below the surface and are being dubbed man-made earthquakes
