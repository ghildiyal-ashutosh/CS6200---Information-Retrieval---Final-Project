concrete is a composite material composed of aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement which hardens over time most use of the term concrete refers to portland cement concrete or to concretes made with other hydraulic cements such as ciment fondu however road surfaces are also a type of concrete asphaltic concrete where the cement material is bitumen in portland cement concrete and other hydraulic cement concretes when the aggregate is mixed together with the dry cement and water they form a fluid mass that is easily molded into shape the cement reacts chemically with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix which binds all the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses often additives such as pozzolans or superplasticizers are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials such as rebar embedded to provide tensile strength yielding reinforced concrete famous concrete structures include the hoover dam the panama canal and the roman pantheon the earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the ancient romans and concrete was widely used in the roman empire the colosseum in rome was built largely of concrete and the concrete dome of the pantheon is the worlds largest unreinforced concrete dome today large concrete structures for example dams and multi-storey car parks are usually made with reinforced concrete after the roman empire collapsed use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the mid-18th century today concrete is the most widely used man-made material measured by tonnage the word concrete comes from the latin word concretus meaning compact or condensed the perfect passive participle of concrescere from con- together and crescere to grow perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement was twelve million years ago a deposit of cement was formed after an occurrence of oil shale located adjacent to a bed of limestone burned due to natural causes these ancient deposits were investigated in the 1960s and 1970s on a human timescale small usages of concrete go back for thousands of years concrete-like materials were used since 6500bc by the nabataea traders or bedouins who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern syria and northern jordan they discovered the advantages of hydraulic lime with some self-cementing properties by 700 bc they built kilns to supply mortar for the construction of rubble-wall houses concrete floors and underground waterproof cisterns the cisterns were kept secret and were one of the reasons the nabataea were able to thrive in the desert some of these structures survive to this day in both roman and egyptian times it was re-discovered that adding volcanic ash to the mix allowed it to set underwater similarly the romans knew that adding horse hair made concrete less liable to crack while it hardened and adding blood made it more frost-resistant crystallization of strtlingite and the introduction of pyro-clastic clays creates further fracture resistance german archaeologist heinrich schliemann found concrete floors which were made of lime and pebbles in the royal palace of tiryns greece which dates roughly to 1400-1200 bc lime mortars were used in greece crete and cyprus in 800 bc the assyrian jerwan aqueduct 688 bc made use of waterproof concrete concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures the romans used concrete extensively from 300 bc to 476 ad a span of more than seven hundred years during the roman empire roman concrete or opus caementicium was made from quicklime pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice its widespread use in many roman structures a key event in the history of architecture termed the roman architectural revolution freed roman construction from the restrictions of stone and brick material and allowed for revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension concrete as the romans knew it was a new and revolutionary material laid in the shape of arches vaults and domes it quickly hardened into a rigid mass free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick modern tests show that opus caementicium had as much compressive strength as modern portland-cement concrete ca 200 kilograms per square centimetre 20mpa 2,800psi however due to the absence of reinforcement its tensile strength was far lower than modern reinforced concrete and its mode of application was also different modern structural concrete differs from roman concrete in two important details first its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate which in roman practice often consisted of rubble second integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension whereas roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension the widespread use of concrete in many roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day the baths of caracalla in rome are just one example many roman aqueducts and bridges such as the magnificent pont du gard have masonry cladding on a concrete core as does the dome of the pantheon after the roman empire the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between 500 and the 14th century from the 14th century to the mid-18th century the use of cement gradually returned the canal du midi was built using concrete in 1670 and there are concrete structures in finland that date from the 16th centurycitation needed perhaps the greatest driver behind the modern usage of concrete was smeatons tower the third eddystone lighthouse in devon england to create this structure between 1756 and 1759 british engineer john smeaton pioneered the use of hydraulic lime in concrete using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate a method for producing portland cement was patented by joseph aspdin on 1824 reinforced concrete was invented in 1849 by joseph monier in 1889 the first concrete reinforced bridge was built and the first large concrete dams were built in 1936 hoover dam and grand coulee dam there are many types of concrete available created by varying the proportions of the main ingredients below in this way or by substitution for the cementitious and aggregate phases the finished product can be tailored to its application with varying strength density or chemical and thermal resistance properties aggregate consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix generally a coarse gravel or crushed rocks such as limestone or granite along with finer materials such as sand cement most commonly portland cement is associated with the general term concrete a range of materials can be used as the cement in concrete one of the most familiar of these alternative cements is asphalt concrete other cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag cement are sometimes added as mineral admixtures see below - either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component - and become a part of the binder for the aggregate to produce concrete from most cements excluding asphalt water is mixed with the dry powder and aggregate which produces a semi-liquid that workers can shape typically by pouring it into a form the concrete solidifies and hardens through a chemical process called hydration the water reacts with the cement which bonds the other components together creating a robust stone-like material chemical admixtures are added to achieve varied properties these ingredients may accelerate or slow down the rate at which the concrete hardens and impart many other useful properties including increased tensile strength entrainment of air andor water resistance reinforcement is often included in concrete concrete can be formulated with high compressive strength but always has lower tensile strength for this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension often steel mineral admixtures are becoming more popular in recent decades the use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties the most conspicuous of these are fly ash a by-product of coal-fired power plants ground granulated blast furnace slag and silica fume a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces the use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement this displaces some cement production an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process while reducing the amount of industrial waste that must be disposed of mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced the mix design depends on the type of structure being built how the concrete is mixed and delivered and how it is placed to form the structure portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage it is a basic ingredient of concrete mortar and many plasters english masonry worker joseph aspdin patented portland cement in 1824 it was named because of the similarity of its color to portland limestone quarried from the english isle of portland and used extensively in london architecture it consists of a mixture of calcium silicates alite belite aluminates and ferrites - compounds which combine calcium silicon aluminium and iron in forms which will react with water portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone a source of calcium with clay andor shale a source of silicon aluminium and iron and grinding this product called clinker with a source of sulfate most commonly gypsum in modern cement kilns many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced cement kilns are extremely large complex and inherently dusty industrial installations and have emissions which must be controlled of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete the cement is the most energetically expensive even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then grind it into cement many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes the most common being used tires the extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels combining water with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration the cement paste glues the aggregate together fills voids within it and makes it flow more freely a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger more durable concrete whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher slump impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure hydration involves many different reactions often occurring at the same time as the reactions proceed the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass reaction fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture sand natural gravel and crushed stone are used mainly for this purpose recycled aggregates from construction demolition and excavation waste are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates while a number of manufactured aggregates including air-cooled blast furnace slag and bottom ash are also permitted the presence of aggregate greatly increases the durability of concrete above that of cement which is a brittle material in its pure state and also reduces cost and controls cracking caused by temperature changes thus concrete is a true composite material redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration this can lead to strength gradients decorative stones such as quartzite small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative exposed aggregate finish popular among landscape designers in addition to being decorative exposed aggregate may add robustness to a concrete concrete is strong in compression as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load however it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack allowing the structure to fail reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars steel fibers glass fibers or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads chemical admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes in normal use admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batchingmixing see the section on concrete production belowthe common types of admixtures are as follows inorganic materials that have pozzolanic or latent hydraulic properties these very fine-grained materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete mineral admixtures or as a replacement for portland cement blended cements products which incorporate limestone fly ash blast furnace slag and other useful materials with pozzolanic properties into the mix are being tested and used this development is due to cement production being one of the largest producers at about 5 to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions as well as lowering costs improving concrete properties and recycling wastes concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredientswater aggregate cement and any additivesto produce concrete concrete production is time-sensitive once the ingredients are mixed workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens in modern usage most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a concrete plant or often a batch plant in general usage concrete plants come in two main types ready mix plants and central mix plants a ready mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water a central mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used since hydration begins at the plant a concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments machinery to accurately weigh move and mix some or all of those ingredients and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete often to a concrete mixer truck modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid so that it may be poured into forms which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape there are many different ways in which concrete formwork can be prepared such as slip forming and steel plate construction alternatively concrete can be mixed into dryer non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture precast concrete products there is a wide variety of equipment for processing concrete from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery whichever equipment builders use however the objective is to produce the desired building material ingredients must be properly mixed placed shaped and retained within time constraints any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top this creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a cold joint between the two batches once the mix is where it should be the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes during concrete preparation various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product when initially mixed portland cement and water rapidly form a gel of tangled chains of interlocking crystals and components of the gel continue to react over time initially the gel is fluid which improves workability and aids in placement of the material but as the concrete sets the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place during curing the cement continues to react with the residual water in a process of hydration in properly formulated concrete once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and chemical properties among the qualities typically desired are mechanical strength low moisture permeability and chemical and volumetric stability thorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform high-quality concrete for this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce uniform mixtures of the lowest slump practical for the work separate paste mixing has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with aggregates can increase the compressive strength of the resulting concrete the paste is generally mixed in a high-speed shear-type mixer at a wcm water to cement ratio of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass the cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders superplasticizers pigments or silica fume the premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment workability is the ability of a fresh plastic concrete mix to fill the formmold properly with the desired work vibration and without reducing the concretes quality workability depends on water content aggregate shape and size distribution cementitious content and age level of hydration and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures like superplasticizer raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability excessive water leads to increased bleeding andor segregation of aggregates when the cement and aggregates start to separate with the resulting concrete having reduced quality the use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water workability can be measured by the concrete slump test a simplistic measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the astm c 143 or en 12350-2 test standards slump is normally measured by filling an abrams cone with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete the cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level non-absorptive surface it is then filled in three layers of equal volume with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer when the cone is carefully lifted off the enclosed material slumps a certain amount owing to gravity a relatively dry sample slumps very little having a slump value of one or two inches 25 or 50mm out of one foot 305mm a relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches workability can also be measured by the flow table test slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or superplasticizer without changing the water-cement ratio some other admixtures especially air-entraining admixture can increase the slump of a mix high-flow concrete like self-consolidating concrete is tested by other flow-measuring methods one of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted after mixing concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed a common misconception is that concrete dries as it sets but the opposite is true - damp concrete sets better than dry concrete in other words cement is hydraulic water allows it to gains strength too much water is counterproductive but too little water is deleterious curing allows concrete to achieve optimal strength and hardness curing is the hydration process that occurs after the concrete has been placed in chemical terms curing allows calcium-silicate hydrate c-s-h to form to gain strength and harden fully concrete curing requires time initially setting and becoming rigid though very weak and gaining in strength in the weeks following in around 4 weeks typically over 90% of the final strength is reached though strengthening may continue for decades the conversion of calcium hydroxide in the concrete into calcium carbonate from absorption of co2 over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage however this reaction called carbonation lowers the ph of the cement pore solution and can cause the reinforcement bars to corrode hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength resulting in greater shrinkage cracking the early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking high-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking the strength of concrete changes increases for up to three years it depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation during this period concrete must be kept under controlled temperature and humid atmosphere in practice this is achieved by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water thereby protecting the concrete mass from ill effects of ambient conditions the picture to the right shows one of many ways to achieve this ponding submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to contain the water in the mix additional common curing methods include wet burlap andor plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete or by spraying on a water-impermeable temporary curing membrane properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the exothermic setting of cement improper curing can cause scaling reduced strength poor abrasion resistance and cracking to ensure full hydration during curing concrete slabs are often sprayed with curing compounds that create a water-retaining film over the concrete after full curing the film abrades from the concrete through normal use pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate cement water and little-to-no fine aggregates this concrete is also known as no-fines or porous concrete mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles the hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totalling approximately 15 to 25 percent water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath air entrainment admixtures are often used in freezethaw climates to minimize the possibility of frost damage nano concrete is created by high-energy mixing hem of cement sand and water using a specific consumed power of 30 - 600 wattkg for a net specific energy consumption of at least 5 kjkg of the mix a plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer in the hem process sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles the quasi-laminar flow of the mixture characterized with reynolds number less than 800 is necessary to provide more effective energy absorption this results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of calcium silicate hydrate c-s-h colloid creation the initial natural process of cement hydration with formation of colloidal globules about 5nm in diameter after 3-5 min of hem spreads out over the entire volume of cement water matrix hem is the bottom-up approach in nanotechnology of concrete the liquid activated mixture is used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items or foamed expanded for lightweight concrete hem nano concrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel which drastically reduces capillarity in solid and porous materials bacteria such as bacillus pasteurii bacillus pseudofirmus bacillus cohnii sporosarcina pasteuri and arthrobacter crystallopoietes increase the compression strength of concrete through their biomass not all bacteria increase the strength of concrete significantly with their biomass 143 bacillus sp ct-5 can reduce corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete by up to four times sporosarcina pasteurii reduces water and chloride permeability b pasteurii increases resistance to acid 146 bacillus pasteurii and b sphaericuscan induce calcium carbonate precipitation in the surface of cracks adding compression strength 147 concrete has relatively high compressive strength but much lower tensile strength for this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension often steel the elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops concrete has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and shrinks as it matures all concrete structures crack to some extent due to shrinkage and tension concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to creep tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths concrete strength values are usually specified as the compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen where these values usually differ by around 20% for the same concrete mix different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes very low-strength - 14mpa 2,000psi or less - concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air foams or lightweight aggregates with the side effect that the strength is reduced for most routine uses 20mpa 2,900psi to 32mpa 4,600psi concrete is often used 40mpa 5,800psi concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable although more expensive option higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects strengths above 40mpa 5,800psi are often used for specific building elements for example the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of 80mpa 11,600psi or more to keep the size of the columns small bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required occasionally other structural needs may require high-strength concrete if a structure must be very rigid concrete of very high strength may be specified even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads strengths as high as 130mpa 18,900psi have been used commercially for these reasons concrete is one of the most durable building materials it provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time structures made of concrete can have a long service life concrete is used more than any other manmade material in the world as of 2006 about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year more than one cubic meter for every person on earth large concrete structures such as dams navigation locks large mat foundations and large breakwaters generate excessive heat during cement hydration and associated expansion to mitigate these effects post-cooling is commonly applied during construction an early example at hoover dam installed a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating similar systems are still used depending on volume of the pour the concrete mix used and ambient air temperature the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures another approach to mass concrete structures that is becoming more widespread is the use of roller-compacted concrete which uses much lower amounts of cement and water than conventional concrete mixtures and is generally not poured into place instead it is placed in thick layers as a semi-dry material and compacted into a dense strong mass with rolling compactors because it uses less cementitious material roller-compacted concrete has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional concrete prestressed concrete is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in compressive stresses during construction to oppose those experienced in use this can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs by better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement for example a horizontal beam tends to sag prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this in pre-tensioned concrete the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting or for post-tensioned concrete after casting more than 55,000 miles 89,000km of highways in the united states are paved with this material reinforced concrete prestressed concrete and precast concrete are the most widely used types of concrete functional extensions in modern days see brutalism concrete roads are more fuel efficient to drive on more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions modern paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving so that a well designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off no longer requiring to discard the rainwater using drains also means that less electricity is needed more pumping is otherwise needed in the water distribution system and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water rather it is immediately absorbed by the ground energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site similarly relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials although large amounts of co2 are produced by the chemical reactions in cement manufacturecitation needed the overall embodied energy of concrete is therefore lower than for most structural materials other than woodcitation needed once in place concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home the thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings by storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling concretes thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs while insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building insulating concrete forms icfs are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames for the same effect as above concrete as a fire shield for example fondu fyre can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad options for non-combustible construction include floors ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete for walls concrete masonry technology and insulating concrete forms icfs are additional options icfs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds hurricanes and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness which results in minimal horizontal movement however this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is require to resist more extreme forces as discussed above concrete is very strong in compression but weak in tension larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures these shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads concrete structures without reinforcement like other unreinforced masonry structures can fail during severe earthquake shaking unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally these risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings eg school buildings in istanbul turkey concrete can be damaged by many processes such as the expansion of corrosion products of the steel reinforcement bars freezing of trapped water fire or radiant heat aggregate expansion sea water effects bacterial corrosion leaching erosion by fast-flowing water physical damage and chemical damage from carbonatation chlorides sulfates and distillate watercitation needed the micro fungi aspergillus alternaria and cladosporium were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the chernobyl reactor leaching aluminium iron calcium and silicon concrete can be viewed as a form of artificial sedimentary rock as a type of mineral the compounds of which it is composed are extremely stable many concrete structures are built with an expected lifetime of approximately 100 years but researchers have suggested that adding silica fume could extend the useful life of bridges and other concrete uses to as long as 16,000 years coatings are also available to protect concrete from damage and extend the useful life epoxy coatings may be applied only to interior surfaces though as they would otherwise trap moisture in the concrete a self-healing concrete has been developed that can also last longer than conventional concrete concrete is widely used for making architectural structures foundations brickblock walls pavements bridgesoverpasses highways runways parking structures dams poolsreservoirs pipes footings for gates fences and poles and even boats concrete is used in large quantities almost everywhere mankind has a need for infrastructure the amount of concrete used worldwide ton for ton is twice that of steel wood plastics and aluminum combined concretes use in the modern world is exceeded only by that of naturally occurring water concrete is also the basis of a large commercial industry globally the ready-mix concrete industry the largest segment of the concrete market is projected to exceed 100 billion in revenue by 2015 in the united states alone concrete production is a 30-billion-per-year industry considering only the value of the ready-mixed concrete sold each year given the size of the concrete industry and the fundamental way concrete is used to shape the infrastructure of the modern world it is difficult to overstate the role this material plays today the manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences some are harmful some welcome and some both depending on circumstances a major component of concrete is cement which similarly exerts environmental and social effects 142 the cement industry is one of the three primary producers of carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas the other two being the energy production and transportation industries as of 2001 the production of portland cement contributed 7% to global anthropogenic co2 emissions largely due to the sintering of limestone and clay at 1,500c 2,730f concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to surface runoff which can cause heavy soil erosion water pollution and flooding but conversely can be used to divert dam and control flooding concrete is a contributor to the urban heat island effect though less so than asphalt workers who cut grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne silica which can lead to silicosis concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution the presence of some substances in concrete including useful and unwanted additives can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity fresh concrete before curing is complete is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete structures concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for disposal but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness governmental laws and economic benefits concrete which must be free of trash wood paper and other such materials is collected from demolition sites and put through a crushing machine often along with asphalt bricks and rocks reinforced concrete contains rebar and other metallic reinforcements which are removed with magnets and recycled elsewhere the remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size larger chunks may go through the crusher again smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects aggregate base gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions on 3 march 1983 a government-funded research team the virl researchcodep estimated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based wastecitation needed the world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the three gorges dam in hubei province china by the three gorges corporation the amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million cubic meters over 17 years the previous record was 12.3 million cubic meters held by itaipu hydropower station in brazil the world record for concrete pumping was set on 7 august 2009 during the construction of the parbati hydroelectric project near the village of suind himachal pradesh india when the concrete mix was pumped through a vertical height of 715m 2,346ft the world record for the largest continuously poured concrete raft was achieved in august 2007 in abu dhabi by contracting firm al habtoor-ccc joint venture and the concrete supplier is unibeton ready mix the pour a part of the foundation for the abu dhabis landmark tower was 16,000 cubic meters of concrete poured within a two-day period the previous record 13,200 cubic meters poured in 54 hours despite a severe tropical storm requiring the site to be covered with tarpaulins to allow work to continue was achieved in 1992 by joint japanese and south korean consortiums hazama corporation and the samsung ct corporation for the construction of the petronas towers in kuala lumpur malaysia the world record for largest continuously poured concrete floor was completed 8 november 1997 in louisville kentucky by design-build firm exxcel project management the monolithic placement consisted of 225,000 square feet 20,900m2 of concrete placed within a 30-hour period finished to a flatness tolerance of ff 54.60 and a levelness tolerance of fl 43.83 this surpassed the previous record by 50% in total volume and 7.5% in total area the record for the largest continuously placed underwater concrete pour was completed 18 october 2010 in new orleans louisiana by contractor c j mahan construction company llc of grove city ohio the placement consisted of 10,251 cubic yards of concrete placed in a 58.5 hour period using two concrete pumps and two dedicated concrete batch plants upon curing this placement allows the 50,180-square-foot 4,662m2 cofferdam to be dewatered approximately 26 feet 7.9m below sea
