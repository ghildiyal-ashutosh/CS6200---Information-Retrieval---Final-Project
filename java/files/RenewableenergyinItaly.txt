renewable energy primary consumption in italy was 11.2 mtoe of hydroelectricity 36 and 5.6 mtoe or 3.5% of world total of other renewables in 2010 according to bp statistical review of world energy 2011 38 this was an increase of 22% over the previous year for renewables other than hydro the combined primary energy from renewables accounts for about 10% of the total primary energy consumption in italy which was 172 mtoe in 2010 40 the urge to produce exclusively green energy in italy came from the need to reduce the countrys historical heavy dependence on fossil fuels and supply flows of hydrocarbons coming from eastern europe the middle east and north africa and to comply with the binding international agreements of the kyoto protocol signed in 1997 and implemented in 2005 during the twentieth century italy was at the forefront of technological development and the production of energy from renewable sources in the field of geothermal energy the first plant dates back to 1904 at larderello in tuscany where in 1913 the first geothermal power plant was also built and remained the only one in the world until 1958 with regards to hydropower the first plant in europe was built in paderno dadda in lombardy between 1895 and 1898 in the solar energy industry the first power plant that could produce steam at 450c was built in genoa in 1963 and in 1980 the first solar power tower that uses mirrors was built at adrano in sicily as for the production of wind power the first experimental projects sponsored by the national research council and in collaboration with enel were started in the second half of the seventies as part of the restructuring of the entire system of production and supply of energy that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crisis during the eighties and the nineties renewable energy projects drew new life from three co-occurring factors the rapid price increase of crude oil caused by the tension and armed conflicts in the middle east and persian gulf a new public awareness of environmentalism fuelled by the chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the interruption of all construction of nuclear power plants in italy and the ban on enel on the participating in the construction or management of nuclear power plants beyond national borders following the referendum of 1987 renewable electricity accounted for the 24.5% of all electric energy produced in italy in 2011 this percentage is growing rapidly and reached 38.5% in 2013 when a spike in hydroelectric production contributed with more than 9 twh during the first quarter of 2014 renewables already generated 39,8% of all electric energy produced and 49,1% during april in 2011 the total gross capacity was 41,352 mw and the total energy produced during the year was 84,190 gwh in 2013 the energy produced during the year was 106.5 twh italy is experiencing a surge in renewable energy investments and production in latest years especially in wind and solar energy total electricity produced from solar pv quintupled in 2011 compared to the previous year this was mainly due to a drop in costs and to high incentives introduced since 2005 the italian fossil fuel electricity generation sector is undergoing a profound crisis many italian power plants burning fossil fuels are now running at half capacity and others are in the process of being shut down italy has a 17 percent target in its total energy use set by the european union for 2020 italy may have to import renewable energy to meet these targets italy has planned to subsidize electric cars transport accounts for a large amount of fossil fuel use so a quick transition to sustainable transport such as electric cars and trams will be a key element of transition to renewable energy use the italian national renewable energy action plan has a target to reach the total share of renewable energies to 26% 39% in the electricity sector 17,09% in the heatingcooling sector and 14% in the transport sector by 2020 on june 16 2013 renewables covered 100% of the entire italian electricity demand for 2 hours
