a rain garden is a planted depression or a hole that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs driveways walkways parking lots and compacted lawn areas the opportunity to be absorbed this reduces rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground as opposed to flowing into storm drains and surface waters which causes erosion water pollution flooding and diminished groundwater they should be designed for specific soils and climates the purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as groundwater rather than being sent through stormwater drains straight out to sea rain gardens can cut down on the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30% native and adapted plants are recommended for rain gardens because they are more tolerant of ones local climate soil and water conditions have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities and overall sustainability once established there can be trade-offs associated with using native plants including lack of availability for some species late spring emergence short blooming season and relatively slow establishment the plants a selection of wetland edge vegetation such as wildflowers sedges rushes ferns shrubs and small trees take up excess water flowing into the rain garden water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system root systems enhance infiltration maintain or even augment soil permeability provide moisture redistribution and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration also through the process of transpiration rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere a more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture channel divert and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property the whole garden can become a rain garden and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself in developed areas natural depressions where storm water would pool are filled in the surface of the ground is often leveled or paved storm water is directed into storm drains which often may cause overflows of combined sewer systems or poisoning erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff redirected storm water is often warmer than the groundwater normally feeding a stream and has been linked to upset in some aquatic ecosystems primarily through the reduction of dissolved oxygen do storm water runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events these pollutants include volatile organic compounds pesticides herbicides hydrocarbons and trace metals rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of storm water and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration they also reduce energy consumption for example the cumulative storage capacity of these rain gardens exceeds a conventional stormwaters systems by 10 times the national science foundation the united states environmental protection agency and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or chemical reduction of the pollutants to benign compounds rain gardens are often located near a buildings roof drainpipe with or without rainwater tanks most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings a french drain may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events by reducing peak stormwater discharge rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural water cycle displaced by urban development and allow for groundwater recharge while rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge and reduced stormwater volumes they may also increase pollution unless remediation materials are included in the design of the filtration layers the primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain gardens filtration system can handle during storm-water events this challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period the initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust native plants and encouraging adequate biofiltration but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce redox of incoming pollutant streams rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons improve water quality by filtering runoff provide localized flood control are aesthetically pleasing and provide interesting planting opportunities they also encourage wildlife and biodiversity tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all a rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls reducing or avoiding the need for irrigation they allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems rain gardens differ from retention basins in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two this creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow mosquitoes to breed the first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred naturally before development of an area the rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in prince georges county maryland when dick brinker a developer building a new housing subdivision had the idea to replace the traditional best management practices bmp pond with a bioretention area he approached larry coffman the countys associate director for programs and planning in the department of environmental resources with the idea the result was the extensive use of rain gardens in somerset a residential subdivision which has a 300400sqft 2837m2 rain garden on each houses property this system proved to be highly cost-effective instead of a system of curbs sidewalks and gutters which would have cost nearly 400,000 the planted drainage swales cost 100,000 to install this was also much more cost effective than building bmp ponds that could handle 2- 10- and 100-year storm events flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 7580% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event this is also referred to as water sensitive urban design wsud in australia sustainable urban drainage systems or suds in the united kingdom and low impact development lid in the united states and is cited by the epa on their website as a success on the stormwater case studies section of their website this webpage has many links to information on prince georges countys literature on implementing lid in a community some de facto rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant lid tool any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function vegetated roadside swales now promoted as bioswales remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world what is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make sustainable development possible this is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting bioretention into built stormwater management systems as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path a rain garden requires an area where water can collect and infiltrate and plants to maintain infiltration rates diverse microbe communities and water holding capacity transpiration by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms this includes any plant extending roots to the garden area simply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established however many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off ones roof than people realize often the required location and storage capacity of the garden area must be determined first rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation not the other way around when an areas soils are not permeable enough to allow water to drain and filter properly the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed this bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% sand 20% compost and 20% topsoil and there is a current trend to replace compost with biochar existing soil must be removed and replaced do not combine the sandy soil bioretention mixture with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content otherwise the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance as demonstrated in a 1983 study deep plant roots also create additional channels for storm water to filter into the ground microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates a five-year usgs study indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least 25 inhour however type d soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly sometimes a drywell with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation however a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an infiltration basin defeating its purpose depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer the more polluted the water the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification this is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table in some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly rain gardens are at times confused with bioswales swales slope to a destination while rain gardens do not however a bioswale may end with a rain garden drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series saving time and money on maintenance part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a water garden wetland or pond and not a rain garden using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results plants selected for use in a rain garden should tolerate both saturated and dry soil using native plants is generally encouraged this way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native butterflies birds and beneficial insects well planned plantings require minimal maintenance to survive and are compatible with adjacent land use trees under power lines or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression yet do not excessively shade the garden that said shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out dissolved oxygen thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation
