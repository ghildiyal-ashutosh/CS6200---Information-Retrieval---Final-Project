overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem a prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to inevitable environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases generally the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of overpopulation that is the more people the more consumption of raw materials to sustain their lives currently the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world who make up the majority of the human population 7.4 billion people the theory was coined to augment the discussion of overpopulation which reflects issues of carrying capacity without taking into account per capita consumption by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support green parties and the ecology movement often argue that consumption per person or ecological footprint is typically lower in poor than in rich nations planned obsolescence is by definition a method of stimulating consumer demand by designing products that wear out or become outmoded after limited use this is a key factor of overconsumption while we have the capabilities resources and technology to create products that could last one a lifetime producers do not practice this efficient idea because if they did they would generate little profit and crumble under the competitive free market system a fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planets carrying capacity excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ecological overshoot and subsequent resource depletion environmental degradation and reduced ecological health the scale of modern lifes overconsumption has enabled an overclass to exist displaying affluenza and obesity however once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption in the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources and in the worst case a malthusian catastrophe lester brown of the earth policy institute has said it would take 1.5 earths to sustain our present level of consumption environmentally the world is in an overshoot mode the worldwatch institute said china and india with their booming economies along with the united states are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global biosphere the state of the world 2006 report said the two countries high economic growth exposed the reality of severe pollution the report states that the worlds ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of china india japan europe and the united states as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way the idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint the term ecological footprint refers to the resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere a study by mathis wackernagel has shown that the global ecological footprint was in overshoot by 4 global hectares per person or roughly 23% of these developing countries china presents the largest threat currently china is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the usa it is estimated that if china developed to the level of the united states that world consumption rates would roughly double the most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming depleted less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries such as renewable energy and recycling technologies to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden a fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include anti-consumerism freeganism green economics ecological economics degrowth frugality downshifting simple living minimalism and thrifting other researchers and movements such as the zeitgeist movement suggest a new socioeconomic model which through a structural increase of efficiency collaboration and locality in production as well as effective sharing increased modularity sustainability and optimal design of products is expected to reduce resource-consumption the united states uses double the resources that it producescitation needed pulling from other countries to produce the goods for its population to consume the goods are not just simple perishables like food energy and light building materials the united states also consumes the most clothing items metals plastics electronics and even health hazardous chemicalscitation needed overconsumption has became a big issue in the fashion industry due to the influence of fast fashion the business model of fast fashion is based on consumers desire for new clothing to wear in order to fulfill consumers demand fast fashion brands provide affordable prices and a wide range of clothing that reflects the latest trends this ends up persuading consumers to buy more items which leads to the issue of overconsumption planned obsolescence plays a key role in overconsumption based on the study of planned obsolescence in the economist fashion is deeply committed to built-in obsolescence last years skirts for example are designed to be replaced by this years new models in this case fashion goods are purchased even when the old ones are still wearable the quick response model and new supply chain practices of fast fashion even accelerate the speed of it in recent years the fashion cycle has steadily decreased as fast fashion retailers sell clothing that is expected to be disposed of after being worn only a few times this dramatically shortens the consumers buying cycle the quick changing stocks and low price of fashion goods encourage consumers to visit the store and make purchases more frequently as a result excessive stock and untrendy clothes tends to end up in landfills a recent article about fast fashion in huffington post pointed out that in order to make the fast moving trend affordable fast-fashion merchandise is typically priced much lower than the competition operating on a business model of low quality and high volume low quality goods make overconsumption more severe since those products have a shorter life span and would need to be replaced much more often furthermore as both industry and consumers continue to embrace fast fashion the volume of goods to be disposed of or recycled has increased substantially however most fast-fashion goods do not have the inherent quality to be considered as collectables for vintage or historic collections the low quality goods can only end up as waste hardly to be recycled these cycles of providing affordable price to trigger the sales and the low quality comes with it that makes products last shorter are making consumers unconsciously buying more not only does it drive sales numbers but also the amount of waste that comes with it fast fashion brings considerable consumption that prospers the fashion industry its unique business model and low prices enables the public to purchase fashionable items even during times of the economic recession however it has brought along the problem of overconsumption whereby countless amounts of waste ends up in landfills moreover hidden costs of landfills also include waste pollution energy and natural resources exhaustion
