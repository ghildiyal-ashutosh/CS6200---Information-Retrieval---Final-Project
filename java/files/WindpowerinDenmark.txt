denmark was a pioneer in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s and today a substantial share of the wind turbines around the world are produced by danish manufacturers such as vestas and siemens wind power along with many component suppliers wind power produced the equivalent of 42.1% of denmarks total electricity consumption in 2015 increased from 33% in 2013 and 39% in 2014 in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50% by 2020 and to 84% in 2035 denmark had the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014 as concerns over global warming grew in the 1980s denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita primarily due to the coal-fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises renewable energy became the natural choice for denmark decreasing both dependence on other countries for energy and global warming pollution denmark adopted a target of cutting carbon emissions by 22% from 1988 levels by 2005 on 29 march 1985 one year before the chernobyl disaster the danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants in the process the danish grassroots movement had a substantial role the danish anti-nuclear movements ooa smiling-sun logo atomkraft nej tak nuclear power no thanks spread worldwide and the renewable alternatives were promoted by the danish organisation for renewable energy ove planning of wind power was deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles many countries tried to subsidize green technology such as wind power and most failed to make a viable industry the danish system was an exception providing 30% of initial capital cost in the early years which was gradually reduced to zero but still maintaining a feed-in tariff denmark has relatively modest average wind speeds in the range of 4.95.6ms measured at 10m height onshore wind resources are highest in the western part of the country and on the eastern islands with coastlines facing south or west the country has very large offshore wind resources and large areas of sea territory with a shallow water depth of 515m where siting is most feasible these sites offer higher wind speeds in the range of roughly 8.59.0ms at 50m height there have been no major problems from wind variability although there is a temporary problem resulting from the connection of a large bloc of wind power from offshore wind farms to a single point on a weak section of the transmission network the wind resource over denmark was mapped in 1999 by emd international as and ris national laboratory the mapping was made using a 200m grid resolution using the models in windpro and wasp the results were validated on more than 1200 wind turbines nationwide denmark is connected by transmission line to other european countries eg cross-skagerrak at an electricity interconnection level transmission capacity relative to production capacity of 44% and has traditional power plants therefore it does not need to install additional peak-load plants to balance its wind power instead it purchases additional power from its neighbours when necessary with some strengthening of the grid denmark plans to increase winds share even further to 50% of consumption in 2020 and up to 84% in 2035 danish district heating plants use 100 petajouleyear but little of this consumption is from 180mw of electrode boilers installed in powerplants or 37mw of large heat pumps the boilers are only used to soak up the powerplants own electricity when prices are negative to avoid paying tax expansion of wind powered district heating is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes analysts expect the cost of wind power to be 30 rekwh and its handling cost to be 15 rekwh being lower than coal and natural gas at 55 rekwh minimum due to their inability to follow load wind power gets a lower price at the end of 2014update denmarks capacity stands at 4,792mw denmark has the highest proportion of wind power in the world with production in 2015 denmark set 42% of electricity from wind up from the 2014record of 39% of total power consumption for the month of january 2014 that share was over 61% the month of lowest wind power share was july at 23% however denmark also has 548mw of solar power for 21 december 2013 the wind share was 102% and for 1 hour the share was 135% in 2005 denmark had installed wind capacity of 3,127mw which produced 23,810tj 6.6twh of energy giving an actual average production of 755mw at a capacity factor of 24% in 2009 denmarks capacity grew to 3,482mw most of the increase came from the 209mw horns rev 2 offshore wind farm which was inaugurated on september17 2009 by crown prince frederik in 2010 capacity grew to 3,752mw and most of the years increase came from the rdsand-2 off-shore wind farm in 2014 the largest increase came from the 400mw anholt wind farm wind power output reduces spot market prices in general via the merit order effect in 2008 this caused a net reduction of pre-tax electricity prices balancing the increase from the feed-in law as denmark continues to install additional capacity they continue to set new production records this is a natural consequence of capacity growth on july 9 2015 in the evening unusually strong wind conditions resulted in 116% of national electricity consumption being produced by wind farms and at 3am the next morning at low demand wind production exceeded 140% of current demand on 22 march 2012 a coalition of parties representing 95% of all members of the danish parliament agreed that the danish state would increase the countrys offshore wind capacity by 1,500mw the 1,500mw extra capacity will be achieved by constructing the future offshore wind farms horns rev 3 with a capacity of 400mw in the north sea at 77 rekwh and kriegers flak with a capacity of 600mw in the baltic sea close to the borders of germany and sweden kriegers flak will also be used to connect denmark and germany with a 400mw cable through the german baltic 2 offshore wind farm and energinet ordered electrical equipment in january 2016 in addition 6 nearshore wind farms with a total capacity of up to 450mw will be constructed along with 50mw of experimental offshore wind farms the first 350mw were called for tenders in 2015 with a maximum price of 70 rekwh horns rev 3 is set to be operational in 2019 while kriegers flak and all the nearshore wind farms are set to be fully operational around 2021 eight groups applied for pre-qualification for kriegers flak of which 7 were approved - 3 more than the 4 companies approved to compete for horns rev 3 both having more bidders than the single bidder for anholt in addition to the offshore projects a further 500mw additional net capacity of onshore windfarms is expected be constructed until 2020 the 500mw of additional net capacity is the expected result of the scrapping of 1,300mw capacity from obsolete wind turbines combined with the simultaneous building of 1,800mw capacity of modern wind turbines - a process also known as repowering annual wind power production is currently 2014 equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in denmark the proportion of this that is actually consumed in denmark has been disputed as the norwegian hydro power is used as grid storage claims of up to 40% of wind power being exported have been made countered by claims that only 1% was exported according to the first argument power in excess of immediate demand is exported to germany norway and sweden the latter two have considerable hydropower resources which can rapidly reduce their generation whenever wind farms are generating surplus power saving water for later and can export electricity to denmark when wind power output drops part of the benefit of this goes to denmarks neighbours when denmarks wind farms are exporting power it is sold at the spot market price which sometimes falls to near or below zero according to the second argument the correlation between exports and wind power is weak and a similar correlation exists with conventional thermal plants meanwhile causal analysis shows that export from denmark typically occurs as a consequence of the merit order effect when large thermal plants have reserve capacities at times the spot market price of electricity is high in any case the export price is the intermediate between the prices of the two areas so the exporting tso energinet uses the profit to relieve tariffs at around dkk 500 million per year this service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found around the world in pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants wind power organizations state that denmark exports power at a higher price than it imports at for timeshifting trade with norway denmark exports at dkk 157mwh and imports at dkk 212mwh in 2014 there were 46 hours with negative prices costing dkk 37.7 million in 2015 negative prices occurred in 65 hours in west denmark and 36 hours in east denmark - less than 1% of the time the whole date of september 2 was the first time that no central power plants were running the danish wind turbine industry is the worlds largest around 90% of the national output is exported and danish companies accounted for 38% of the world turbine market in 2003 when the industry employed some 20,000 people and had a turnover of around 3billion euro the return of investment dropped from near 20% before the financial crisis to 10% some years later the danish wind turbine industry had a turnover of dkk 84 billion in 2014 the biggest wind turbine manufacturers with production facilities in denmark are vestas and siemens wind power the development of wind power in denmark has been characterized by a close collaboration between publicly financed research and industry in key areas such as research and development certification testing and the preparation of standards for example in the 1980s a large number of small danish companies were developing wind turbines to sell to california and the danish ris laboratory provided test facilities and certification procedures these resulted in reliable products and the rapid expansion of the danish turbine manufacturing industry new large turbines between 4-8 mw including some non-danish ones are being tested at sterild denmark has mediocre electricity costs including costs for cleaner energy in eu but welfare taxes increase the price to the highest in europe actual consumer-paid incentives pso to new wind turbines depend on year of commission but is generally around 25 re 3.4 eurocent per kwh for a limited amount of hours although support is discounted if combined price exceeds 58 rekwh pso is also used for biomass solar and district heating total pso was dkk 5.8 billion in 2013 of which dkk 3.2 billion went to wind power wind power displaces coal oil and gas to some degree reducing running cost for fossil fuels consumption of coal was more than halved over 10 years in 2009 the institute for energy research commissioned the danish think-tank cepos centre for political studies to report on electricity exports from denmark and the economic impact of the danish wind industry this heavily criticized report states that danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the european union mostly for government revenue but partly to subsidize wind power and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 dkk 87 us124 it also estimated that 90% of wind industry jobs were transferred from other technology industries and states that as a result danish gdp is 1.8billion dkk us270million lower than it would have been without wind industry subsidies of 1.7-2.6 billion dkk roughly 320m - 480m yearly in 2001-2005 the report was later heavily criticised firstly danish engineering magazine ingeniren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the american oil and coal lobby through ier later several danish researchers and professors from all technical universities in denmark wrote a joint response to the report refuting it the report from cepos was even brought to government level where minister of climate and energy lykke friis discredited the work done by cepos and the report to encourage investment in wind power families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining municipality while this could involve purchasing a turbine outright more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines by 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country opinion polls show that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines with some 86% of danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources the role of wind turbine cooperatives is not limited to single turbines the middelgrunden offshore wind farm with 20turbines the worlds largest offshore farm at the time it was built in 2000 is 50% owned by the 10,000 investors in the middelgrunden wind turbine cooperative and 50% by the municipal utility company as is the avedre near-shore turbines by 2001 over 100,000 families belonged to wind turbine cooperatives which had installed 86% of all the wind turbines in denmark by 2004 over 150,000 were either members or owned turbines and about 5,500 turbines had been installed although with greater private sector involvement the proportion owned by cooperatives had fallen to 75% the cooperative model has also spread to germany and the netherlands the island of sams erected 11 one-megawatt land-based wind turbines in 2000 followed by ten offshore 2.3mw wind turbines completed in 2003 together with other renewable energy measures this community of 4,200 achieved fame claiming that it is the largest carbon-neutral settlement on the planet not in citation given this claim exploits the general discourse that one can neglect carbon-dioxide and other pollution from fossil fuel consumption cars imported electricity heating for houses if the yearly average electricity production from sustained sources is higher than the total energy consumedcitation needed
