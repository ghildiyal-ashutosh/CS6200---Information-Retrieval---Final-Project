the energy efficiency of different types of transportation ranges from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre for a bicycle to several megajoules for a helicopter efficiency can be expressed in terms of for freight transport rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking and air freight is much less efficient a 68kg 150lb person walking at 4kmh 2.5mph requires approximately 210 kilocalories 880kj of food energy per hour which is equivalent to 4.55kmmj 1 us gallon 3.8l of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units 120mj of energy so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon 0.65l100km velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation at a speed of 50kmh 31mph the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5kwh of food energy per 100km to transport the passenger which is around 15 20% of a normal bicycle and 150 2% of an average fossil fuel or electric car this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon 2000kml or 0.05 l100km other sources give a figure of 13.4 29.5% of the energy efficiency of a normal bicycle a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport a 64kg 140lb cyclist riding at 16kmh 10mph requires about half the energy per unit distance of walking 43kcalmi 27kcalkm or 3.1kwh 11mj per 100km this converts to about 732mpg-us 0.321l100km 879mpg-imp this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance a motorized bicycle such as the velosolex allows human power and the assistance of a 49cm3 3.0cuin engine giving a range of 160to 200mpg-us 1.51.2l100km 190240mpg-impcitation needed electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0kwh 3.6mj per 100kmcitation needed while maintaining speeds in excess of 30kmh 19mphcitation needed these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70% of the work with around 3.6mj 1.0kwh per 100km coming from the motor including the human energy dramatically changes the efficiency of cycles quoted above as with walking this would include the increase in food consumption due to caloric efficiency of human muscle and cardiovascular efficiency however only the rise in food consumption above the diet of a non-cyclist should be considered to be thorough a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing transporting and packaging of fuel food or fossil fuel the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment while automobiles for example require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans in addition any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres l100km but in some countries including the usa uk and india it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed kml or miles per us or imperial gallon this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel the oak ridge national laboratory ornl states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 btu per us gallon 32mjl compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon 36.4mjl for diesel a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy bio-fuels electricity and hydrogen for instance have significant energy inputs in their production because of this the 50-70% efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger we can compare for instance the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58 finally vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span in other words vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem compare for example walking which requires no special equipment at all and an automobile produced in and shipped from another country and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again and used for a limited number of years it has been researched that driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15% a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l100km per passenger 1.4 mjpassenger-km 49 passenger-miles per gallon in 1998citation needed note that on average 20% of seats are left unoccupied jet aircraft efficiencies are improving between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall fuel efficiency gain if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4% concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus states a fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l100km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon as over 80% of the fully laden take-off weight of a modern aircraft such as the airbus a380 is craft and fuel there remains considerable room for future improvements in fuel efficiencycitation needed the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing can be retrofitted to any airplane and smooths out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircrafts wing drag nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb 230kg blended wing aircraft this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over todays more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph 700kmh this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current dated info high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engineairframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate cunard states that the rms queen elizabeth 2 travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil 3.32ml or 41.2ftusgal and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777 thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon 16.9l100pkm or 13.9pmpgus emma maersk uses a wrtsil-sulzer rta96-c which consumes 163gkwh and 13,000kgh if it carries 13,000 containers then 1kg fuel transports one container for one hour over a distance of 45km the ship takes 18 days from tanjung singapore to rotterdam netherlands 11 from tanjung to suez and 7 from suez to rotterdam which is roughly 430 hours and has 80mw 30mw 18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots 46kmh gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles 20,000km a sailboat much like a solar car can locomote without consuming any fuel however often energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion such as cooking heating or lighting the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine the speed at which it travels and its displacement due to the high viscosity of water with a single passenger the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car train or plane trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply for electrified systems and importantly end-to-end delivery where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey actual consumption depends on gradients maximum speeds loading and stopping patterns data produced for the european meet project methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19to 33kwhkm 68119mjkm 3153kwhmi the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger for example tgv double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy energy consumption estimates for rail freight vary widely and many are provided by interested parties some are tabulated below considering only the energy spent to move the train and taking as example the urban area of lisbon train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers if we consider energy spent per passenger-km considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6l100km 47mpg-imp 39mpg-us of gasoline the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 wh one gets on average 441wh 1,590kj per passenger-km on the other hand a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20% of total capacity which has a consumption of about 8.5kwhkm 31mjkm 13.7kwhmi one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km 20 times less than the automobile stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency modern electric trains like the shinkansen the bullet train use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6% of the total energy consumed the passenger rail urban and intercity and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements final report states that commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops and that we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent of total energy consumed by commuter railways having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20% of the energy wasted in braking weight is a determinant of braking losses aea study of road and rail for the united kingdom department for transport final report rail and bus are generally required to serve off peak and rural services which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines moreover due to their walk on ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers as a consequence the overall load factor on uk railways is 35% or 90 people per train conversely air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are pre-book in nature using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 70-90% however recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques with loads reaching typically 71% overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the uks virgin trains services for emissions the electricity generating source needs to be taken into account the us transportation energy data book states the following figures for passenger transportation in 2009 the us transportation energy book states the following figures for freight transportation in 2010 from 1960 to 2010 the efficiency of air freight has increased 75% mostly due to more efficient jet engines 1 us gal 3.785 l 0.833 imp gal of fuel can move a ton of cargo 857 km or 462 nm by barge or 337km 209mi by rail or 98km 61mi by truck compare natural resources canadas office of energy efficiency publishes annual statistics regarding the efficiency of the entire canadian fleet for researchers these fuel consumption estimates are more realistic than the fuel consumption ratings of new vehicles as they represent the real world driving conditions including extreme weather and traffic the annual report is called energy efficiency trends analysis there are dozens of tables illustrating trends in energy consumption expressed in energy per passenger km passengers or energy per tonne km freight comparing fuel efficiency in transportation has several challenges
