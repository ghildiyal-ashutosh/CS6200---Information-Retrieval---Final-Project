radiators are heat exchangers used to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of cooling and heating the majority of radiators are constructed to function in automobiles buildings and electronics the radiator is always a source of heat to its environment although this may be for either the purpose of heating this environment or for cooling the fluid or coolant supplied to it as for engine cooling despite the name most radiators transfer the bulk of their heat via convection instead of thermal radiation the main exception to this rule being the radiators on spacecraft see spacecraft radiators below though the term convector is used more narrowly see radiation and convection below the roman hypocaust a type of radiator for building space heating was described in 15 ad the heating radiator was invented by franz san galli a polish-born russian businessman living in st petersburg between 1855 and 1857 one might expect the term radiator to apply to devices that transfer heat primarily by thermal radiation see infrared heating while a device which relied primarily on natural or forced convection would be called a convector in practice the term radiator refers to any of a number of devices in which a liquid circulates through exposed pipes often with fins or other means of increasing surface area the term convector refers to a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed radiators are commonly used to heat buildings in a central heating system hot water or sometimes steam is generated in a central boiler and circulated by pumps through radiators within the building radiators are used for cooling internal combustion engines mainly in automobiles but also in piston-engined aircraft railway locomotives motorcycles stationary generating plants and other places where such engines are used to cool down the engine a coolant is passed through the engine block where it absorbs heat from the engine the hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the radiator located either on the top of the radiator or along one side from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator as the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which in turn transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each row of tubes the fins then release the heat to the ambient air fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air thus increasing the exchange efficiency the cooled coolant is fed back to the engine and the cycle repeats normally the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating this coolant is usually water-based with the addition of glycols to prevent freezing and other additives to limit corrosion erosion and cavitation however the coolant may also be an oil the first engines used thermosiphons to circulate the coolant today however all but the smallest engines use pumps up to the 1980s radiator cores were often made of copper for fins and brass for tubes headers and side-plates while tanks could also be made of brass or of plastic often a polyamide starting in the 1970s use of aluminium increased eventually taking over the vast majority of vehicular radiator applications the main inducements for aluminium are reduced weight and cost however the superior cooling properties of copper-brass over aluminium makes it preferential for high performance vehicles or stationary applications in particular mw-class installations copper-brass constructions are still dominant see copper in heat exchangers cuprobraze is a copper-alloy heat exchanger technology for harsh temperature and pressure environments such as those in the latest generations of cleaner diesel engines mandated by environmental regulations its performance advantages over radiators made with other materials include better thermal performance heat transfer size strength durability emissions corrosion resistance repairability and antimicrobial benefits since air has a lower heat capacity and density than liquid coolants a fairly large volume flow rate relative to the coolants must be blown through the radiator core to capture the heat from the coolant radiators often have one or more fans that blow air through the radiator to save fan power consumption in vehicles radiators are often behind the grille at the front end of a vehicle ram air can give a portion or all of the necessary cooling air flow when the coolant temperature remains below the systems designed maximum temperature and the fan remains disengaged as electronic devices become smaller the problem of dispersing waste heat becomes more difficult tiny radiators known as heat sinks are used to convey heat from the electronic components into a cooling air stream heat is transferred to the air by conduction and convection a relatively small proportion of heat is transferred by radiation owing to the low temperature of semiconductor devices compared to their surroundings radiators are found as components of some spacecraft these radiators work by radiating heat energy away as light generally infrared given the temperatures at which spacecraft try to operate because in the vacuum of space neither convection nor conduction can work to transfer heat away on the international space station these can be seen clearly as large white panels attached to the main truss they can be found on both manned and unmanned craft
