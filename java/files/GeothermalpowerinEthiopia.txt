energy in ethiopia is energy and electricity production consumption and importation in ethiopia primary energy use in 2009 in ethiopia was 380 twh and 5 twh per million persons hydropower accounts for the bulk of ethiopias electric power generating capacity and output in 2002 the countrys generating capacity stood at 501mw with hydropower accounting for 451mw and conventional thermal at 50mw electricity production for that same year was 2.024twh of which 2.003twh and 20gwh came from hydroelectric and conventional thermal plants respectively electric power consumption in 2002 totaled 1.882twh in 2008 electricity production was 3.715 twh the expected completion of the gilgel gibe iii dam will add 1870 mw capacity to the countrys power production more than doubling the countrys production however ethiopias heavy reliance upon hydropower to supply its electric power has made the country vulnerable due to lengthy droughts ethiopia has small reserves of oil and natural gas as of january 2003 the countrys crude oil and natural gas reserves were placed at 428,000 barrels 68,000m3 and 880billion cubic feet 2.51010m3 respectively ethiopia has no crude oil refining capacity and must import all refined petroleum products imports of refined petroleum products totaled 24,910 barrels per day 3,960m3d with consumption was an estimated 23,000 barrels per day 3,700m3d in 2001 in 1997 due to high maintenance and operating costs eritrea and ethiopia agreed to shut down their joint operations at the petroleum refinery at assab and import refined petroleum products in 2001 ethiopia signed an agreement to import petroleum products from sudan which began in january 2003 although ethiopia has few proven hydrocarbon reserves it is estimated to have considerable potential for oil and gas exploration geothermal energy is abundant in the afar region specifically in the erta ale area this article incorporatespublic domain material from websites or documents of the library of congress country studies
