r-410a sold under the trademarked names suva 410a forane 410a puron ecofluor r410 genetron r410a and az-20 is a zeotropic but near-azeotropic mixture of difluoromethane ch2f2 called r-32 and pentafluoroethane chf2cf3 called r-125 which is used as a refrigerant in air conditioning applications r-410a cylinders are colored pink unlike alkyl halide refrigerants that contain bromine or chlorine r-410a which contains only fluorine does not contribute to ozone depletion and is therefore becoming more widely used as ozone-depleting refrigerants like r-22 are phased out however it has a high global warming potential 1725 times the effect of carbon dioxide similar to that of r-22 since r-410a allows for higher seer ratings than an r-22 system by reducing power consumption the overall impact on global warming of r-410a systems will be substantially lower than that of r-22 systems due to reduced greenhouse gas emissions from power plants r-410a was invented and patented by allied signal now honeywell in 1991 other producers around the world have been licensed to manufacture and sell r-410a but honeywell continues to be the leader in capacity and sales r-410a was successfully commercialized in the air conditioning segment by a combined effort of carrier corporation emerson climate technologies inc copeland scroll compressors a division of emerson electric company and allied signal carrier corporation was the first company to introduce an r-410a based residential air conditioning unit onto the marketplace in 1996 and holds the trademark puron r-410a has replaced r-22 as the preferred refrigerant for use in residential and commercial air conditioners in japan europe and the united states parts designed specifically for r-410a must be used as r-410a operates at higher pressures than other refrigerants thus r-410a systems require service personnel to use different tools equipment safety standards and techniques equipment manufacturers are aware of these changes and require the certification of professionals installing r-410a systems in addition the acr safety coalition has been created to help educate professionals about r-410-a system in accordance with terms and agreement reached in the montreal protocol the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer the united states environmental protection agency has mandated that production or import of r-22 along with other hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs be phased-out in the united states in the eu and the usa virgin r22 cannot be used for manufacture of new air conditioning or similar units from 1 january 2010 in other parts of the world the phase-out date varies from country to country today all newly manufactured window unit air conditioners mini split air conditioners and central air conditioning systems in the united states come with r-410a only thermophysical properties - httptwtmpeiacrutthb2r410a-enghtml
