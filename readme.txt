* Python Package required to install:
    - nltk(http://www.nltk.org/)
    - unirest(http://unirest.io/)

* All queries are stored in "quries" file.
    - File names that ends with "OriginalIncluded" include both original terms and expanded terms. These versions are used in our project.
    - All queries can be re-generated by running "getQueries.py" in "python" directory.
    - Note that when running "getQueries.py", we need two text files "similar.txt" and "derivative.txt" (in "python" directory). These files store all expansion terms in the 64 queries. To re-generate these files, we need to run "getWordInfo.py", which access the WORDS API (https://www.wordsapi.com/), and a free account only have 2500 hits per day (by one hit we get information about one word). It should be enough for two or three runs.

* For evaluation, simply run the file "evaluation.py" in "python" directory.
    - Note that when running evaluation, we need to comment line 46 and 47 of file "evaluation.py". However when running BM25, we need to uncomment these two lines (this is the only python file called by the java project).

* Run search engines (implemented in Java)
    - To run Lucene, you'll have to include all the files in "lucene" folder to a new project and run "lucene.java"
    - In the "java" folder, run "Executer.java", you'll get the results in "../results/" folder.
    - To run the BM25 search engine, you'll have to unzip all the files under "java" folder, include all the .java files and execute the "Executer.java" file. The out put will be under "../results/" folder to current "java" folder. Also, please include the jsoup.jar file in the exteral library of the project.
